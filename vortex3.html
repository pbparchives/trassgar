 <P>
Breaking camp at mid-morning, the halfling and she-elf loaded up their mounts
in thoughtful silence.
<P>
After a hasty meal of burnt rabbit the night previous, they had watched with
respect as their wounded dwarven comrade disappeared into the dusty forest
darkness on his pony.
Gnash had insisted that Amber and Tilder continue the trek to the Highlands
without him; in a week he would catch up with them using his boots of speed.
Amber had no doubt the resourceful dwarf made it back before midnight to
Forest's Edge for some needed recuperation.  "And brew!" he had been quick
to add with gusto.  Oh, the songs that must have been sung at Klive's tavern
last night!  When she next saw the innkeeper, she'd have to compare stories
to see how much Gnash had embellished.  She already missed the good-natured
dwarf.
<P>
Alas, personal feelings had to be subordinate to the quest; loyalty clashed
with destiny.  She could handle traveling without Gnash for the time being,
but she would also have to forego investigating Tilder's wild claim.  How
long could she wait?  After monumental search efforts undertaken by several
houses for over a year, the Rangers of the Seventh had been given up for
dead; the possibility (however faint after two years) that they still lived
might renew lagging spirits in the aligned houses, bring them out of
self-imposed isolation and perhaps unite them all against Klaxton Kurl.
But so would recovering the St'eelcoil, in theory.
<P>
Amber's mare whinnied impatiently.  The she-elf peered over at
Tilder, already in the saddle of his pony.  His gaze was fixed on Gnash's path.
The thief's dexterous fingers tied random and complex knots in his pony's
mane.  <EM>This halfling defies explanation,</EM> she thought.  How could a
common thief from such a simple race come across such sought-after knowledge?
And then there was that eerie moment two nights ago when he had immediately
recognized her as royalty and had suggested that she might know him---that she
might have reason to reprimand him.
<P>
These facts could be explained, as she was beginning to suspect, by a
connection with THoR, but how probable was that?  The elves of Trassgar don't
generally associate with halflings, much less recruit them into their ranks.
"History just has too much momentum," she remembered Scurge saying.  She
laughed inwardly at the irony of the quest parameters as researched by Scrub
Shack.  <EM>Perhaps elven schisms might not be the only ones to heal when
the Vortex curse is lifted.</EM>  Ever since the incident with M'ylin, elves
and halflings had not had much good to do with each other.  If Tilder had been
granted access to privileged information through THoR, he must indeed be a
singular halfling, she surmised.  <EM>Or a treacherous thief.</EM>
<P>
"We'd best get a move on, Tilder.  I want to make it to Two Rivers' Forge a
few days before Gnash arrives.  We'll need time to obtain fresh mounts and
rest up before we three tackle the road to Aquus Keep."  <EM>And perhaps along
the way, you might feel inclined to talk, eh, halfling?</EM>  Amber did not
emit her last thought as she climbed up into the saddle.  For now at least,
she would respect Tilder's silence.
<P>
Tilder straightened in his saddle and gestured politely for Amber to lead the
way.  He'd been trying to hide the fact that he felt uncomfortable around
Amber, but he suspected she knew.  It was a feeling he could not quite justify.
Soon after they had passed the trio of fresh graves, he ruled out the
possibility that it might be due to her forwardness and insistence on picking
his brain.  No, his unease was rooted deeper than that.
<P>
The thief was thankful that Amber was content to lead a few pony-lengths ahead.
It gave him opportunity to ponder his anxiety.  As the forested glen broadened
into a flat featureless semi-arid plain, Tilder cradled his emotion and noted
its simultaneous novelty and familiarity.  Yet he dared not examine it too
closely.  He didn't <EM>really</EM> need to ask why, did he?  <EM>Just pass
it off to on-the-quest-jitters, that's right, you dumb ol' thief.
Don't mean a thing....</EM>
<P>
But the steady gait of his pony and the monotony of the scene eventually
took their toll
on his mental restraint.  Trassgar's twin suns, locked in their lofty
barycentric embrace, shined down relentlessly on the questers.  Way down there
on the path to Two Rivers' in the middle of the vast plain, the semi-hypnotic
halfling on the scruffy pony got his answer: dreaded parallels between past
and present manifested themselves again.
<P>
<HR WIDTH="50%">

<P>
Jop resumed in his normal booming voice, "Yeah, so you got that, dolt?  Take
this report to the big K.  And don't get lost this time, cheese-head!" Jop
shoved his first officer away with a neat flick of his meaty hand.  On any
other night,
Tilder would have noted carefully that Jop's swipe would have knocked a
Hairfoot like himself senseless.  But not this night.  Hidden in the shadows
cast by the thick mul-pine, Tilder squinted in deep concentration.  His mind
raced to ingrain the vital directions he'd just obtained from a successful
reading of Jop's lips.
<P>
Tarc picked himself up and straightened his leather armor.  He cracked his
orcish knuckles, slid the rolled parchment into his satchel, and headed uphill.
<EM>The wrong way to Klaxton Kurl,</EM> Tilder noted with a smirk.
Then it dawned upon him: <EM>Tarc's heading towards Rowend!</EM>  But his
view of the departed black sasher was now eclipsed by Bork, who was sauntering
back to his seat with a leaky mug of mead.  Without a smidgen of finesse,
the drunken orc flopped down heavily against the trunk of Tilder's mul-pine
and braved the ensuing assault of liberated pinecones.
<P>
Tilder was still biting his nails and straining his eyes uphill waiting
for the inevitable confrontation, when into the firelight Tarc reappeared,
his face a blanched green.  The thief's heart jolted with anticipation.
<EM>Finty!  He's seen something!</EM>
<P>
"What now, Tuskless?" taunted Jop, exasperated.  The other sashers looked in
Tarc's direction, sensing a good laugh, but the situation turned serious as
Jop rose to his feet, unsheathed his scimitar and walked slowly toward his
shuddering first officer.  Tarc started babbling in fear and pointing uphill,
but Jop silenced him with a quick sweep of his blade across the officer's face.
The sasher campsite was deathly still.
<P>
"Downhill, fool."  With a guttural growl, Jop wiped his weapon on
Tarc's leather shoulder armor and walked back to his seat.
<P>
Tarc lived.  Cheek oozing, he scampered around the fire and into the forest
in the opposite direction, leaving his frightful vision and even scarier
leader behind him.  Tilder breathed out at last.  He wondered what Ellendale
had shown the poor orc.  A shadow dragon, perhaps?  He nearly giggled with
relief.
<P>
The thief smiled.  The information he had obtained would have qualified his
stealthy foray a success a thousand times over.  The location of Klaxton's
lair in the Black Forest!  What a treasure!  But that last thought reminded him
of Amalthea's challenge.  Caught up in his excitement, he decided against his
better judgement.  <EM>Now where did Bork put that gem?</EM>
<P>
While Tilder carefully positioned himself to get a better view of Bork
<FONT COLOR="yellow">[hide in shadows at 65%: 51, silent move at 35%:
18]</FONT>,  the mead-emboldened orc addressed his brooding leader.
"Where'da send'at runt, O peerless Fop---er, (hic) fearless Jop?  Sorry
(burp), heh.  Dat ain'ta way home."  All Tilder could see was Bork's satchel,
about a full arm-span away near the orc's feet, and Bork's left hand,
which grasped his wooden mug and nervously rocked it back and forth on a
mul-pine root.  Tilder did not notice that the mug was not quite empty
<FONT COLOR="yellow">[hear noise at 20%: 38]</FONT>, but he did see Bork's
hand slip limply from his mug, leaving it balanced on the root.
<P>
Jop grunted menacingly as the rowdy sashers became silent once more, but
instead of making an example of Bork, Tilder heard him bellow sardonically,
"Kurl ain't home, Slopface, he's at Ranger Central.  An' if'n Twinkletoes
is lucky, he won't git fed to dem pointy-eared wimps.  Dey'll eat anyting by
now." That last comment broke the tension of the sasher camp, and an avalanche
of guffaws and mugs again assailed Bork. But Bork didn't throw up an arm.
The volumes of mead coursing through his veins had spirited him away into a
deep sleep even before Jop had replied.
<P>
<EM>By the Light of Lothlorien---the lost Rangers!</EM>  Tilder's heart
pounded.  He again debated whether Bork's gem was really worth it.  Probably
not.  But his honor was at stake ("Juicy steak!" as the orcs of <I>Ounze!</I>
would often retort), and Amalthea's respect was certainly worth it.
That did it.  The thief grabbed a nearby stick and slowly extended it
alongside Bork's leg to try to fish open the satchel that lay at his feet.
Unfortunately, he couldn't quite get enough leverage
<FONT COLOR="yellow">[pickpocket at 35%: 96] </FONT>, and the stick,
weakened by lichens, suddenly bent in the middle, leaving the far end dangling.
<EM>Finty!</EM>  Tilder retracted the stick, but the loose end
<FONT COLOR="yellow">[Dex check at -3 for lack of leverage, needs 16 or less:
19]</FONT> accidentally nudged Bork's mug, which toppled with a soft thud and
rolled over near his feet.  Out popped a green gem.  <EM>His</EM> green gem.
<P>
Tilder froze instantly.  The wave of astonishment soon subsided.  And nothing
happened.  The orcs hadn't noticed.  Mouthing thanks to the capricious
goddess, he pocketed the gem, backed slowly away from the mul-pine, and
made his escape back to the elves.  He was a bit hasty <FONT
COLOR="yellow">[silent move: 76]</FONT> and forgot the racknah bones,
but the cracking under his feet was probably lost in the din of
the orc camp.  Crunch! Crunch!
<P>
<HR WIDTH="50%">

<P>
<EM>Crunch! Crunch!</EM>  Tilder's reality suddenly changed.  <EM>Oh yeah,
the road to Two Rivers'.</EM>  He looked down the road behind him at the
sun-baked shattered skull of a small carnivore which his pony had just
trampled noisily.  Judging by the length and angles of their mid-afternoon
shadows,
Tilder guessed he couldn't have been asleep for more than a standard hourglass.
<P>
<EM>Why do my dreams continue like this?</EM>  He felt drained, but a bit more
certain of the cause of his unease around Amber.  He tried to assure himself
that Finty's dice could not fall the same way twice, but his conscience
denied him the luxury of assigning blame to the ever-capricious goddess.
No, history was <EM>his</EM> story, and the future equally lay in his hands.
<P>
As he was sweating all over, Tilder fished around in his saddle bag for
his water skin.
The she-elf slowed her mount at the sudden rustling from her diminutive
companion taking up the rear.  She soon reined in alongside Tilder's pony.
"Whoa, there, thief!  The idea is to drink <EM>more</EM> than you sweat!"
She took a long swig from her water flask as well.  "We're making good time.
Do you want to stop here for a stretch?"
<P>
They did.  Amber hopped down and fed her mare a handful of oats.  "I really
am fine, m'lady.  (glug-glug)  Enjoying the scenery."  Tilder remained on
his pony.
<P>
"Yeah, right.  Must have been dozing then, eh?" she laughed, brushing her
horse's mane.  "You know, Whisperfoot, we are compatriots.  People who risk
their lives with
one another can be on more familiar terms, don't you think?"  she added.
<P>
Tilder shared a laugh or two.  "Sorry, ... Amber.  Just that I have never
been around royalty before you; I'm a mite nervous."
<P>
Amber studied the halfling closely.  <EM>Hmm, none of the usual signs.
He's a good liar.  But could this mean he's been telling the truth all
along?</EM>  She prodded no further.  Evidently, his demons were not quite
finished yet.  She hoped whatever was left of him would be salvageable.
The quest required it.
<P>
"Oh, I don't bite unless provoked.  But let's continue to move.
There's a spring not too far from here, and our four-footed friends need a
drink.  I'll lead."

</p>

<font color="yellow">Elf, halfling, and horses, having been refreshed from a
visit to the trickle of water Amber had expertly found using her well-honed
elven and ranger skills, the troupe continued in a northerly direction toward
Two Rivers' Forge.</font>  The town ahead sat surrounding the split of the
Lanagg river into its northern and southestern components, pinpointed by the
juncture it formed with the Furter River.  The two rushing currents wound
south from their disparate sources, and met at the fertile valley upon which
Amber and Tilder's horses now trod.  Two Rivers' Forge, originally settled
by a collective of humans who farmed the irrigated valley, became a hotbed
of activity when a disgruntled dwarven family migrated from the furnaces
of Krom, and taught the humans how to shape the metals of the land.
<p>
Now, Two Rivers' Forge boasted the hottest furnaces and finest craftsmen
in northern Trassgar.  At least the inhabitants were quick to make those
claims, Amber related to Tilder.  Each knew of the town and had traveled
to it on occasion, but Amber took this opportunity to share the "hidden
history" of the town--knowledge imparted to her by none other than the
displaced dwarf, Gnashuphagnewtogius Gnarly.
<p>
"In fact," Amber joked, "Gnash claims to have been part of that disgruntled
family of dwarves that got this place on the map."  She grinned, and noticed
that her companion smiled, too.
<p>
"I have decided that there's more to Gnash and his adventures than anyone
knows," Amber finished.  
<p>
"We all have our own mysterious pasts," Tilder said, barely aloud.  Amber
nodded slowly, and decided not to press Tilder for the history that seemed to
haunt him.
<p>
"Yes," came Amber's only audible reply.
<p>
The two sat on their horses, on a small rise in the terrain, which gave
them a good view of the town that spread out before them.  The path they
had chosen to follow was well traveled by traders and other folk making
their ways north or south through northern Trassgar.  One such traveler
heading south was a human rider on the back of a large horse.  He carried
a wooden sign in his gloved hands, and had a white cloth tied around his
head which covered his nose and mouth.
<p>
The rider slowed on his approach, and dismounted abruptly.  He
addressed the pair in a bold accent typical of the northern human settlements:
"<font face="MS Sans Serif">I see I've
come just in time to warn the two of you.</font>"  An onlooker to this
gathering might have found it odd not only that an elf and a halfling traveled
together in peace, but that the human newcomer didn't seem to pay much
attention to the unlikely pair.  The human's horse grunted and snorted
at having been led so close to a foreign mare and pony.  Amber and Tilder's
mounts responded in kind, kicking the dust at their feet.
<p>
"Whoah there, buddy!" Tilder half-whispered, patting his pony's neck.  He
squinted to read the print on the sign as the man carried the two
pieces of wooden boards to a distance marking that was chiseled into a roundly
shaped rock at the edge of the path.  Retrieving a mallet from a leather
loop in his pants, the partially masked man gave the sign post two sturdy
knocks which fixed the sign firmly in the dirt.  His horse waited patiently.
<p>
Amber was content to let the man finish his task before inquiring.  She, too,
read the sign, and as the man stepped back to view his effort, he noticed
that the writing on the sign had captivated the attention of the two would-be
visitors to his town.
<p>
"<font face="MS Sans Serif">You read the common tongue?  Good.</font>"  The man
walked back to his horse, and tugged on the stirrups of the saddle.
"<font face="MS Sans Serif">Good, as I won't have to read it for you.
I'd take it seriously, folks.  Two Rivers' Forge isn't for tourists.  It won't
be for a few days.</font>"  He stared at the elf, then the halfling, as
they finished reading the sign and then looked at each other.
<p>
Amber's expression had turned to pity.  Tilder's brow had wrinkled and his
lip was quivering.  Visibly shaken, Tilder broke the silence.  "How. . . how
many?"
<p>
"<font face="MS Sans Serif">We're still counting.  Twenty, so far, come down
from the Furter.  We're taking them out of the current, obviously, hence the
notice.</font>"
The man shook his head.  "<font face="MS Sans Serif">I got. . . I havta get
back.  Understand, normally, I'd say, 'Welcome to the Forge!'
Not today.</font>" He all but pointed a finger at the two travelers.
"<font face="MS Sans Serif">You
folks mind me, now.</font>"  With that said, he climbed back onto his horse,
a brown stallion, and wheeled him around back to the town.
<p>
He took a slow pace; Amber understood why.
<p>
The sign was hastily constructed, with letters etched into the wood and filled
with a black ink, some of which had bled over the cut edges of the letters:
<br>
<table align="center">
<tr>
<td bgcolor="tan" cellpadding="3">

<p>
Tilder and Amber let their horses rest a minute, then looked at each other
to decide what they were going to do.

</h3>
</p>

<P>
Amber had that look on her face. What had Amalthea called it? <EM>Clamming</EM>.
The unflappable elven ranger would roll her eyes skyward and jokingly chide
the heavens whenever Rowend clammed---this usually meant THoR was in for
it, courtesy of another of his trademark gut instincts. His last one was
right on the electrum: they had discovered a band of marauding, monk-killing
black-sashers. Oddly enough, it was not Rowend, but rather Amalthea herself,
whose dare had led to the catastrophe that ended THoR's mission two years
ago. Tilder shivered under Amber's blank stare. <EM>"Elves!"</EM> came the
silent oath. <EM>"The trouble I get into because of elves!"</EM> But he knew
they were only part of a larger equation dominated by his own actions...
and Finty's cursed dice.
<P>
Tilder's attention shifted to the plague warning and more gloomy thoughts.
The black ink that filled the bottommost letters of the sign was still
semi-viscous, and some of it had dripped onto the distance marker below,
marring the smooth stone with sickly splotches. <EM>"Those poor people."</EM>
He suddenly felt itchy. "So much for meeting Gnash at Two Rivers', eh?"
The air swallowed his words on their way to Amber.
<P>
Indeed, Amber had not registered the halfling's timid banter. Her thoughts
were elsewhere, deeply sundered with indecision. Given such a chance on
any other mission, she might have backtracked to the Black Forest to investigate
Tilder's wild claims. <EM>The legendary Rangers of the Seventh!</EM>
What a difference they could make in the land's struggle for freedom from
Kurl's sashers! But another legend promised to wash away Kurl's scourge
when the St'eelcoil was returned to the Vortex, or so Shack's theory went.
Amber had always been the practical sort, trusting honed reflexes and tempered
steel over arcane magic and superstition, but nevertheless, bolstered by a
close fit to the legend parameters described by Shack, she could feel the urgent
tug of destiny. <EM>"Alas, if the Rangers have lasted this long, they can
last a bit longer. Hang on, guys."</EM>
<P>
Tilder's incessant fidgeting finally forced her return to the present.
"Surely you...you are not thinking of going down there?" he stammered.
<P>
Amber broke trance and dismounted. In the same fluid movement, she unsheathed
the St'eelcoil from her mare's saddle and swung it swiftly around to point
gem first at Tilder's bulbous nose. Tilder gasped with fear and nearly
jumped off his pony, but he quickly managed his astonishment and balance.
The scepter's rough-hewn gem, encircled by a metallic trefoil knot, captured
the light of the twin suns and glinted painfully. Amber only made it worse by
rotating the scepter in his face. The thief squinted, oblivious to the random
spears of refracted sunlight dancing across the contours of his visage.
<P>
"Uh, we could leave a note for Gnash and meet him upstream at Aquus
Keep," Tilder offered, spouting the first alternative that sprang to mind.
Anything to break the tense moment, and Amber's eccentric behavior. He
nervously scratched the hair on the back of his left hand. "Or we could
double ba---"
<P>
"Tell me something, halfling. What do you do with a plague victim?"
Amber's question came without warning.
<P>
"I... I don't understand, your maj---er, uh, Amber, yeah."
<P>
Still twirling the St'eelcoil in the thief's face, Amber briefly smiled
at the insistence of Tilder's manners. "The bodies, what do you do with..."
Amber stopped mid-sentence as soon as Tilder comprehended.
<P>
"You burn them."
<P>
"Precisely. Why would these victims have appeared so?" Amber paused.
"See if this makes sense, good thief. Plague doesn't happen anywhere: it
occurs where there is habitation. Furthermore, it takes time for plague
to become epidemic: there is plenty of time to impose containment measures.
Such quarantines are instated to prevent the spread to other settlements,
and less ostensibly, to minimize the risk of retaliation by neighboring
towns for <EM>lack</EM> of quarantine. Now the town below is a superbly armed
community. How could a town upstream <EM>not</EM> burn its plague victims
or fail to keep its walking dead within its own walls and <EM>not</EM> expect
exacting retribution by the weaponsmiths downstream?"
<P>
"Maybe they wanted to burn the bodies on the other side of the river and the
transport barge sank?" Tilder interjected as he satisfied an ankle itch
against a stirrup strap. His pony shook its mane.
<P>
"Hmm. Possibly, but why risk breaking quarantine by crossing the river,
when you could have just burned the bodies in town? It just doesn't appear
likely. The implied scenario: 'a town helplessly quarantined because of
a blunder upstream' just doesn't add up. I smell a conveniently crafted
coverup. Two Rivers' Forge holds a secret, and they want to keep it that way."
<P>
<EM>Oh no.</EM> Tilder knew what was coming. Elves could smell trouble
before it happened, and like a moth to the flame, they were irresistably
drawn to it---at least the elves he'd known. He twisted around, unbuckled
his pack and fished around in its contents as Amber continued.
<P>
"Taking another route, as you suggest, would lessen the chance of
Gnash catching up with us. We've got to stick to our original plan. The
fate of this land depends on upon us, wouldn't you ag---"

<P>At this, Amber
couldn't help but burst out in uncontrollable laughter. Tilder had
swaddled himself up to the eyeballs in a faded indigo blanket, evidently
in anticipation of entering plague country. The blanket looked like it
belonged to Olen's bed back at Highsafe. She briefly wondered how her friends
were doing. But Tilder's struggle to cover every mote of his skin with
the generous blanket of dubious origin realigned her thoughts. She recovered
briefly. "I'll take that as a 'yes'... but---ha!---you look like---a dried
gooseberry!"
<P>
"Mmmf," replied the dried gooseberry.
<P>
"Ah, good point. There's no use letting on that we've called their bluff.
Just make sure you can breathe, Tilder!" Amber donned a silk scarf over her
mouth and nose, and then the pair raced to catch the sign poster before he
entered the gates of the quarantined city.

<p>
<h3 align=center>

</p>

<p>
<font color="yellow">Catch him they did.</font>
<p>
"Excuse me!" Amber called out when they were within comfortable shouting
distance.  The rider whom they pursued stopped his horse almost too eagerly,
and half-turned to face them.  When the distance between the three was short
enough for conversation, he spoke up.
<p>
<font face="MS Sans Serif">"I'm a bit surprised why you two didn't heed
my words,"</font> he began.  <font face="MS Sans Serif">"Then again,
I had you pegged as the curious types."</font>
<p>
Hiding their skepticism, Amber replied.  "We are supposed to meet someone
here in a few days, and have no way to contact him to let him know of an
alternate location."  That was truth, anyway.  "However, we'd also like
to help, if we can."
<p>
The human regarded them for a moment seriously, then beckoned them to ride
along side him, and turned his mount back to the gates.
<p>
They rode in silence.  The questors did not know what to expect, but they
also did not press their suspicions.  When they reached the gate, the human
dismounted, patted his horse, and checked in with the token guard relaxing at
a comfortable-looking booth just inside the stone arch through which
they could see settlement.  Amber and Tilder waited just outside the gate
and took in the scene.
<p>
The Forge was walled off with huge blocks of stone cemented together sturdily.
It seemed as if the surrounding wall was outliving its usefulness as the
buildings inside crawled almost right up to it.  Another few years, Amber
guessed, and they'd need to tear down the wall in the name of expansion.  The
wall itself seemed to echo the sentiment in the elf's thoughts; the windows
and towers positioned periodically as part of the perimeter seemed vacant.
Perhaps there was a time when defense was more a part of this people's daily
regiment--no longer in this day.
<p>
Amber returned her gaze to the archway, where the check-in was apparently
completed.  <em>"That's it?"</em> she wondered to herself.  <em>"In this day
of war, how could these people afford to be so relaxed?  Could it be that
Kurl has decided to ignore this town--for now?  Even so, surely they have
heard of the surrounding skirmishes and mercenary activity."</em>
<p>
<font face="MS Sans Serif">"You two sure you want in?  Your risk, of course."
</font>  Then, a little more quietly, <font face="MS Sans Serif">"We still
don't know what we got here and I hate to see you folks get on the
bad end of it."</font>
<p>
Tilder spied Amber's nod for an instant before he echoed with a slight
hesitation.  <em>"Just as long as we can get out if the bad end isn't
to our liking!"</em> he admitted to himself,
feeling more nervous than he thought he would.  He and Amber dismounted,
and followed their host inside the city.
<p>
Nearby the entrance were a tethering post and water trough on the porch
of a stable.  The three led their horses there and wrapped the leather
straps of their horses' bridles around the post.
<p>
<font face="MS Sans Serif">"I've been a lousy host, but, well, that was
sort of the point at first.  But since you're here...."</font>  The man
extended his hand first to Amber, who shook it firmly, and then to Tilder,
who responded in kind.  <font face="MS Sans Serif">"My name is Bell Prathem.
I run a woodshop near the main furnace, but I also volunteer in the town
watch.  I literally saw this mess coming."</font>  He shook his head.
<font face="MS Sans Serif">"Ok, I take it you wanna know the whole story.
Frankly, maybe a pair</font>--he considered Tilder with an almost worried
look on his face--<font face="MS Sans Serif">"or two, of outsiders' eyes
is what we need here."</font>
<p>
Bell offered a coin to a man who'd
stepped up to care for his horse.
<font face="MS Sans Serif">"Let's go see the Constable."</font>
Amber and Tilder followed suit and dug in their pouches, knowing
they'd most likely be here a while--unless, perhaps, it really were a plague.
<font color="yellow">[Ok, for those keepin' track, that'll be one silver from
the each of ya; modify yer sheets as needed.]</font>
<p>
Bell turned and headed east down the stretch of path that appeared to run
northeast through the town.  They passed a few inns and taverns almost
immediately, as expected, and soon came to an older building than the rest
of the establishments passed by already.
<p>
There was a finely crafted sign hanging from a couple of steel links on the
overhang of the roof.  In a fine script was etched, "ye local constabulary"
in the common written word.  Amber appreciated the craftsmanship, and the
thought of woodcarving reminded her of her dwarven friend whom she hoped
was resting comfortably in Forest's Edge now.
<p>
Bell noticed Amber's  gaze.  <font face="MS Sans Serif">"A beauty, isn't
she?"</font> he boasted <em>to Tilder</em>.
<p>
Amber wasn't sure he was talking about the sign, and half-blushed.  She
wasn't used to such candor from anyone other than a particular burly dwarf.
<p>
Tilder giggled, and held his hand in praise to the sign.
<p>
Amber silently thanked him for changing the focus of the conversation away
from her.
<p>
"I sure'd say so, Mr. Prathem!" the halfling chimed.
<p>
It was Amber's turn for mirth; she chuckled to herself, and realized that the
halfling generally was quite polite with folks taller than him--at first,
anyway.
<p>
Inside, they met with the Constable.  He was a rather large man, in height
and width, and it did not seem like his job demanded too many a strenuous 
activity.  Just like the rest of the citizens in Two Rivers' Forge, he wore
a cloth that covered his nose and mouth.
<p>
"We saw the warning," Amber offered after introductions were made.
<p>
<font face="MS Sans Serif">"And yet you still chose to enter."</font>
The Constable spoke matter-of-factly.  <font face="MS Sans Serif">"Curious,"
</font> he continued, and looked at Bell as if for an explanation.
<p>
The signmaker defended his position.  <font face="MS Sans Serif">"Well,
they want to help if they can, since they're supposed to stay for a few
days to wait on a friend.</font>
<p>
Amber nodded, raised her thin eyebrows.  "I have spent a lot of my years
in the forests east of here.  If there is a mystery out there, I certainly
want to do my part in figuring it out."  She found it was easy to tell
the truth without revealing her original motives for investigation.  If
some kind of mess was coming from Furterville, she realized, it
might mean more trouble for her homeland.  Amber suddenly grew weary.
<em>"Will it never end?"</em>
<p>
<font face="MS Sans Serif">"We've decided to dispatch a couple of the
local adventurers-for-hire up the river, to see if they can find out where
these bodies jumped in the river."</font>  His face was one big grimace.
Clearly he was worried at what they might find.
<font face="MS Sans Serif">"Apart from that, our experts in, shall we say,
the state of affairs of the deceased, are still trying to pinpoint the
cause of death."</font>
<p>
"But you think it's plague, right Mr. Constable?" Tilder asserted with the
slightest bit of challenge to his voice.
<p>
If he felt challenged, the Constable did not let on.
<font face="MS Sans Serif">"That's the story they're telling us, lad."</font>
<p>
Bell agreed.
<font face="MS Sans Serif">"And that's the story we're telling outsiders,
until we find out differently.  And we, they, may not find out
differently."</font>
<p>
Now, Tilder addressed Bell.  His face betrayed a bit of understanding.
<font color="yellow">[int checks: Tilder: 11 Yea!  Amber: 15 Doh!]</font>
"You think that we--that <em>I</em>--can help, don't you?"</font>
<p>
Amber looked at Tilder, puzzled.
<p>
<font face="MS Sans Serif">"Yes, we do,"</font> Bell conceded.
<p>
Amber slid her gaze at the two Forgemen, eyes more curious for understanding
than a thief trying to comprehend a pilfered magic scroll.
<p>
<font face="MS Sans Serif">"The dead.  They're all halfling."</font>
