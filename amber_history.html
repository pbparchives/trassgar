<P><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua">Excerpts from Amber's personal journal</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua">I am the second-born to Malakah and Epsia
of the Third House of Trassgar. Born in a time of tranquility for my realm,
I grew up frolicking in the wood in and around Furterville. My brother,
Lem, took me into secret caves, hidden glens, and shady pools while playing
adventurers on a holy quest. We learned to tie ropes, skim canyon rims,
tiptoe across tree limbs and walk among the leaves without the slightest
rustle, all in hopes of sneaking up on our uncle. Try as we may, we couldn't
quite make it to the edge of his wood without him calling our names and
beckoning us to come in for tea and tarts. It wasn't until much later that
we realized his magic alerted him to our presence every time.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua">As we grew older more siblings were added
to our family. Kara soon began to want to tag along, and Mother wouldn't
allow us to exclude her. "Family is your highest priority," she would say,
"One day you'll realize how important your sister is to you." How right
she was. But, at the time, Kara was a nuisance. She couldn't quite get
her night knot tight enough, and she always managed to snap a twig when
we were just about to snare a racknah. I would get so mad at her! But then
she would look at me with those big purple eyes of hers, and I would get
even madder at myself. Cursed twigs. So, we finally gave in and began teaching
her the art of sneaking through the woods. We introduced her to our games
with our uncle, and wouldn't you know it, before long she was staying with
him after tea and tarts, to learn more of his magic. Often we would sit
with them, but Kara had much more a knack for the magic than we. Uncle
Ipseh successfully taught Lem and I a few things, but sooner than later
we were bored and would head back out to the krimtrees, streams and woods
that beckoned us. I was surprised at how much I missed her the hours she
was with uncle. But she never completely left our games. She would often
play tricks on us with her magic, and try to sense where we were in the
wood. Her play added much to our games!</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua">It wasn't long before Mother and Father told
us that they were expecting another stripling. Lilkahg was among us before
we knew it. He was a strange looking little fellow—a bit furrier than we
would have expected of a he-elf. He was always so quiet. Father used to
say that he was the only stripling with the manners to wake Mother without
screaming bloody murder. The truth was he was just quiet, and has always
remained so. Because he was so quiet, he could pull off all kinds of tricks
without getting into trouble. Lem and I would always get blamed, and the
more we protested the more trouble we were in, so we just took the punishment
that should've been Lilkahg's. It was much easier to bloody his nose later
for our trouble than to convince Father that it was quiet little Lilkahg
who had put meatsalt in the most expensive bottle of fairywine. Still,
for all of his mischief Lilkahg made a wonderful playmate. He integrated
into our games well, and could hide, it seemed, in the slightest shadows.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua">It was during one of our games that we were
first awakened to the dark cloud that was overtaking our lands. Lem, Kara,
Lilkahg and I were playing in a secluded glen on the north side of the
Blue River. We weren't supposed to venture that far from home, but Father
was hunting with some nobles from the Southern Regions nearby, so we had
talked Mother into letting us explore, and camp with some guardians near
Father's encampment. It was supposed to be a one day trip.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua">Lem was hiding in a tree, perfectly blended
with the moss and leaves growing in a patch above a clearing. Kara was
inside of a stump, trying to project a field of transparency. Lilkahg was
in the shadow of a withering vine, and I was looking for them. I saw Kara
clearly, but it often hurt her feelings is we spotted her first every time,
so I decided to look for one of my brothers first. As I rounded the corner
and headed into the clearing, I smelled an orc, and froze in my tracks.
The orc was upwind, of that I was sure, and wait, there was more than one.
Many. I whistled a low, pulsing whistle, the signal that we were in trouble.
I saw Kara shudder, and start to tremble. Quickly, I darted to her hiding
place and pulled her into a small crevice in a rock face nearby. There,
we hid together, hoping that the orcs would pass us by. She seemed to relax
a bit, which was good. I hoped secretly that she did not feel my dagger,
out of its sheath and ready. I saw Lem look at me, his sword pulled and
lying slightly beneath his cloak. We knew without saying a word that orcs
so near Father's camp could only mean one thing—an attack. Lilkahg watched
Lem carefully, and as soon as Lem gave a nod he was off—slinking through
the shadows to Father's camp, trying to make it before the attack force
arrived and warn the nobles and Father of the danger. I didn't worry about
Lilkahg. Even if he didn't make it to warn Father, he would be safe. However,
I did worry about the three of us. Kara wasn't ready yet for magical combat,
and fighting of any type frightened her. Lem could handle one orc, maybe
even two, and so could I, but what about the other twenty-three? And there
was someone with them, a dwarf. Should the dwarf decide to fight, we wouldn't
have much of a chance. A dwarf was worth a dozen orcs.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua">A half-hour passed and they were very close.
I saw them enter the clearing, with four men of origin unknown to me, wearing
black sashes around their thighs. The last contingent of orcs was carrying
a bloody dwarf, who was swearing at them using words I had never heard
before. Whatever they were, I was sure they weren't pleasant. The look
on the orcs' faces confirmed my suspicions.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua">Kara's breath was fast and shallow. I put
my hand over hers reassuringly, but my heart was beating just as quickly
as one of the black sashes stopped right beneath Lem. He paused, looked
straight up into the tree, and turned to face his fellow travelers. "This
looks like a good place to set camp," he said. "King Malakah and the Southern
Princes should be over the ridge finishing their evening hunt. We will
make camp here and slit their throats before dawn. Tie the dwarf to that
tree near the rock face. He won't be going anywhere until Kurl sends him
to meet his perverse dwarven god!" He laughed as he spit in the dwarf's
direction. The dwarf, badly beaten and reeking of vinegar water, looked
at the black sash and smiled a strange smile. Then, he looked at me, and
I could have sworn I saw him wink. "Surely he can't see me," I thought.
And then he looked away, so I thought no more of it, for the time being.
I had other things to worry about. The orcs were approaching, preparing
to tie the dwarf to a tree less than a meter from our hiding place. I saw
Lem tense, and I nodded at him reassuringly. I felt confident that the
stupid orcs would not see us, and if they smelled us it would do nothing
but give them visions of a hot meal, which would send them rambling back
to the others who were building a fire.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua">My intuition was correct, and before Kara
could have a heart attack the orcs were on their way back to the main clearing.
To my surprise, I heard a muffled, raspy voice call to me, "Little girl!"
Kara almost jumped out of her skin. "Shhhh…" I admonished her. We waited.
"Pppsssst! Little lady!" he whispered again. There was no mistaking it
now, he had seen us, and he was talking to me.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua">"Yes, dwarf, I hear you," I replied.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua">"You must get out of here, and protect yourselves,"
he said, and continued, "run as far as you can and hide again until this
is over."</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua">"I can't, dwarf, for my brother is on that
limb above the camp. I cannot leave him," I said quietly, "However, I will
cut you loose and you can leave."</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua">"If you cut me loose I shall not leave" the
burly dwarf gruffed angrily, "but I shall kill as many of those orcs and
black sashes as I can before I die!"</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua">This rather boisterous comment attracted the
attention of one of the black sashes. "Who are you talking to little creature?
Praying that your gods might help you? Ha! No one can help you now. Your
children will be fatherless and your wife in the bed of another and no
one will even miss a stupid little one like you. Remember that, stupid
creature." And yet, the black sash looked closely around the tree, making
sure there were no allies of the dwarf hiding there. Lem, tense and tired,
signaled to me to cut the dwarf loose on his signal. "Run," he mouthed,
"Run until you can run no more when you have cut him loose." As the black
sash turned to walk back to the clearing, he had a clear view of Lem's
hiding place. Lem was good at concealment, but even he could not hide himself
from a clear view very easily. His jeweled ring sparkled and danced with
the firelight, and it caught the black sashes attention. He walked closer
to investigate, and Lem gave me the signal.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua">As quickly as I could, I leapt from my hiding
place and slashed through the dwarf's bonds. Handing him a dagger, I enlisted
him into our plan with nigh a word. He nodded, and I wasted no more time.
I grabbed Kara's hand, and we ran into the dark wood.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua">I never saw Lem alive again. I do not remember
much of what happened after Kara and I entered the darkness of the wood.
We heard the sounds of swords clashing in battle, and the cries of orcs
falling. I could hear the dwarf's bloodlust, and I was sure he was killing
more orcs than I dared hope. But sheer panic propelled me farther and farther
into the wood, and Kara with me. I'm not sure what was leading me, but
after an entire night of running Kara and I awakened to the sounds of running
water to find that I had led us into a secret cave behind a rushing waterfall.
My every muscle and joint ached, and my face and neck were covered with
wounds. "Must've been the branches of the wood," I thought as I moved toward
Kara to check her wounds. She was still sleeping, so I let her rest as
I moved closer to the back of the wall of water. Much to my dismay, I heard
the sounds of orcs searching the wood. After a moment, I realized there
were only three, which gave me some measure of comfort. I could take two,
if I had to, and Kara could outrun one. Still, I felt secure in our hiding
place. We would stay, until I felt it safe to exit our haven. We had water,
and a few rations that we hadn't had the presence of mind to eat the day
before. We could stay in this cave at least a day, possibly two or three
if we had to. I settled back against a rock and continued to listen to
the sounds of the orcs rummaging through the underbrush.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua">I must have dozed off, for I awoke to Kara's
gentle pleadings. "Amber, " she pleaded, "Amber, where's Lem?"</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua">"Kara, listen to me," I started, "Lem will
join us when he can. He had to create enough of a diversion to let us get
away." But even as I said it, I knew it wasn't true, and so did she. Still,
it was a nice delusion to get us through the next few days, until we had
to face what we knew was the inevitable conclusion to the battle in the
clearing the night previous. Thinking of Lem now would only lessen our
chances of getting home, and finding out if Father was alright.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua">For the next three days we stayed in the cave,
sleeping, drinking water, eating our meager rations. It had been two days
since I had smelled or heard an orc. Finally, I felt it safe to leave and
try to find our way home. That is, if there was a home left. We had no
way of knowing how large scale an attack took place. But I couldn't think
that way—I had to get Kara home.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua">The area around the waterfall and pool was
devastated. Clearly they had searched for us for a long, long time before
giving up. Stones were overturned, small trees uprooted, logs rolled on
end. It was hard to find enough undisturbed nature to find my way, but
soon we were headed home.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua">We hadn't gone far and I smelled both elf
and orc. "Quickly, Kara—into the shrubs!" I whispered fiercely. I drew
my dagger, and Kara pulled out spell components for some combat spells
Uncle had just begun teaching her. "We stay hidden until we have no other
choice but to fight. If you see a clear opening, you do not stay to help
me, you run and do not stop until you cannot run anymore, understand?"
I said urgently, my eyes pleading with her not to argue. She nodded, her
big purple eyes welling up with tears. "We will be fine, Kara, just wait
and see." I said, flashing her a wan smile.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua">An elf rounded the corner, poking the bushes
with a stick, prodding as if looking for someone or something. Ready, I
flexed my arm and prepared to plunge my dagger deep into his heart, when
he turned and the sunlight revealed his face. I stopped, and waited. Kara
looked at me, and I nodded. We would wait and be sure. Another elf rounded
the corner, and another, all familiar, all servants of our father. Finally,
we saw the robes of Father. His face haggard and tired, his robes dirty
and wet with dew. I don't know who jumped out of that shrub first, but
before we could blink we were out of the bushes and in his arms.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua">That is the first time I saw my father weep.
I wish it had been the last. He kept looking at us, as if to see if we
were really there, and then he would cry some more. The man-servants stood
guard and averted their eyes, but the sunlight reflected their tears. After
a while, I looked at Father. "Lem?" I ventured. Father shook his head.
Kara began to shake. I felt numb all over. "Lilkahg?" I asked again.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua">"Lilkahg is resting at home with your mother"
He managed. At that, nurses and guards came and carried the three of us
to Father's carriage, and we began the long journey home.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua">&nbsp;</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua">When we arrived home my mother, shaken and
fatigued, greeted us with hugs and kisses innumerable. For the next weeks
she would not let us out of her sight, and we were not allowed to leave
the castle for any reason. My Father was setting up plans to go into hiding,
setting up a temporary place of seclusion and making sure that he had ways
to rule from that place. Lem had been killed by one of the black sashes,
as had the dwarf, but not before they killed seventeen orcs and three of
the black sashes. Father told me later that it was their strength and bravery
that prevented Kara and I from being followed until much later the next
day, by which time we had found hiding. Lilkahg had successfully reached
Father's camp and warned them of the attack. Father and the princes had
mobilized their guards and the legion that always accompanied the king,
and were ready. Two other bands of orcs led by black sashes managed to
attack. The third, was of course, mostly dead due to my brother and the
dwarf.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua">While this battle was being waged, the boat
which carried most of the members of the Sixth House was sunk off the East
Coast of Trassgar. Sabotage was suspected. The leaders of the Fifth House
were assassinated, and an attempt on the lives of their successors was
thwarted. A trusted servant of the Fourth House was found wearing a black
sash around her thigh as she climbed the stairs to the leader's chambers.
Within a week, the entire realm of Northern Trassgar had been plunged into
chaos and war, with Baron Klaxton Kurl.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua">&nbsp;</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua">After the fighting had subsided, Kurl had
taken the Black Forest, land of the Seventh House. Jakal was missing,
and most of her children came to stay with us. Jankira rose to power with
the death of her parents and elder siblings, and surprised us all with
her strength and resolve. Though in seclusion, she maintains an iron grip
on the lands of the Sixth House. The Fifth House was strong, and the Third
and Fourth Houses relatively untouched in the warring. Kurl retreated into
the Black Forrest, holed up on that forest mountain like a fungal snake,
waiting for the right opportunity to strike again. It was in this climate
that I began to train for fighting. Previously, I had been able to play
our childish games in the woods, and that had sufficed in training me to
survive in the wilderness. Now, I attended sword fighting classes and battle
training from the best my Father's military had to offer. I did not intend
to let Kurl get away with murdering my brother. Not even if it took me
a lifetime to make him pay.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua">My family had taken up residence in a secret
place, which I will not divulge here for fear this journal may fall into
the wrong hands. There, my father organized his peoples, and there my mother
continued to grieve for the son she had lost. I don't think she'll ever
be the same. My younger siblings have brought much joy back into her life,
especially my younger brothers. They are too young yet to begin training,
so they are able to spend more time with Mother, playing and letting their
laughter lift her heart. Mother was pregnant with Mara when Lem died. She
had all that she could handle grieving and caring for Mara. Mother always
took care of us herself. For some reason she never trusted servants completely
with our care. Oh, they would help her with us, but never be in charge
of us. But, soon Mara began asking for a little brother or sister, and
not long after Mother was pregnant again, this time with Jakasa. Jakasa
is a happy stripling, always smiling and laughing. Both Mara and Jakasa
were born in the first secret place, which had come to feel like home for
us after so many years. However, that would soon change.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua">About sixty years after Lem's death and the
general seclusion of the High Families, trouble once again surfaced within
our own lands. An assassin had infiltrated my Mother's servants. A maidservant,
she was in charge of helping Jakasa with his bathing and dressing. One
day, as was my Mother's custom, she walked into Jakasa's bathroom to check
on him. She found him submerged at the hands of the maidservant, who was
trying to quiet him. He wanted to alert Mother to the fact that she was
trying to kidnap him—she had a bag packed and his hands tied behind his
little back. Mother killed the she-elf. She broke her neck with one swift
turn, and there was no remorse in her eyes. I remember running in, sword
in hand, because I had heard Mother screaming for help. She looked up at
me, Jakasa held firmly in her arms, and there was in her eyes a calm, resolved
anger that I had never seen. "We have to find him, Amber," she said in
a low voice. "we have to find him and kill him to purge our land of his
evil."</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua">I left my home the next week. Having completed
my training, my Father was at peace with my departure. "Go with the gods,
my child," he said, "and always remember from whence you came." And with
that, I left to find my destiny.</FONT>

<a name="2">
<p align="center">**********</p>

<P><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua">The first thing I did was to familiarize
myself with all of the rumored locations of Kurl's henchmen.  I began my
espionage in the Jack's Bar in Forest's Edge.  Everyone knew that Kurl's
men came into town looking for good drink and bad women, so it seemed the
logical starting place.  Forest's Edge was full of bars and seedy hotels,
so both the soldiers of the Houses and the armies of Kurl partied there.
They avoided one another well enough, and, when they didn't, the murder
and robbery count of Forest's Edge went up another notch.

<p>Why Jack's?  Frankly I got lucky.  Jack's was bad enough that the
covert and anonymous could remain so, but nice enough that it made its
patrons feel respectable.  The henchmen that had any brains drank, gambled
and partied at Jack's.  The maulers and killers hung out down the street.
So, once I had established myself I learned quite a bit.

<p>Establishing myself wasn't difficult to do.  I was a woman, so the men
usually assumed that I was a whore for hire.  Bad assumption.  The first
few were sober--they saw the look in my eyes and took 'no' for an answer.
The fourth was neither sober nor bright, and he was looking for trouble.

<p>I was minding my own business, sitting in my usual corner.  After a 
couple of mugs of mead I was feeling relaxed, and I was seriously
considering turning in early.  So far I hadn't made much headway, and I
was beginning to think that I might need to change my surveillance
tactics.  That's when the slug lumbered in.  He was already drunk; my
guess is that he got bounced out of another bar on his derrier and
decided to try his luck in Jack's.  He was a huge half-orc, hairy in
the places he should have been bald and bald in the places he should have
had hair.  He was looking for some action, and every barwoman cringed at
the thought.  <em>"I pity the one he chooses tonight,"</em> I thought to myself.  Then
Garfdin walked in, one of Kurl's upper eschalon.  My attentions were so focused
on watching Garfdin that I never even realized the half-orc was approaching
me.  Just as I was about to get up to follow Garfdin out the back door
I felt the slug's breath on my neck.  <em>"Great, just great,"</em> I thought as I
realized I had just lost a stellar opportunity.

<p>"Hello, little elf," the orc slurred, "why don't you show me how lithe and
limber you elves are."  And with that, I felt his paws grab my shoulders.  

<p><em>"Think Amber, think!"</em> I thought furiously.  I had to find a way to get this
miserable ugly disgusting creature off me before I drew too much attention
to myself.  "I am not a barwoman, orc." I said quietly.  "Unhand me."

<p>"Who said anything about a barwoman?  I like my women fresh."  His hands were moving.

<p>"I said UNHAND ME!" I said, and jumped up onto the table, facing him.  

<p>"Oh, the little elf is going to get upset isn't she?" he slurred, "we can't have
that!  So let's just say that if you cooperate I will tell Kurl to let you live.
Otherwise, I can kill you where you stand on his authority!"  The orc was angry, and
getting angrier by the minute.  Anger has a way of clearing drunkenness, and he was
looking more sober by the second.  He reached for me, grabbing for the strings on my
tunic and yanking them.  A cheer arose from the crowd as the top part of my bosom was
exposed, and from that point on things get fuzzy.

<p>I remember feeling embarrassed and angry, and I remember drawing my sword.  The orc
drew his, but before he could bring his lumbering arm around he had no head.  I remember
thinking, <em>"who has come to my aid?"</em>  And then I looked down and saw the blood dripping
from my sword.  I dropped it, shocked.  A couple of orcs who were with the slug approached
me, ready to kill me, and they probably would've had a dwarf not come to my aid.

<p>"Step aside, orcs," he said, "you have no business here.  Besides, you're stinkin'
up the place."  The momentary pause gave
me time to collect my senses, and I armed myself once again and stood at the dwarf's 
flank, ready.  The orcs looked at us, paws twitching on the hilts of their swords.  I
met their gaze.  Then they met the gaze of the stocky dwarf who had just stepped in,
and looked at the expressionless head of their
former companion, and lumbered out of the bar.  A cheer went up from the regulars, and
I turned to greet the dwarf.

<p>He was a little shorter and a little fatter than most dwarves I had met, but he had
a sparkle in his eye that belied a quick wit.  After reviewing his face, my eyes were
immediately drawn upward to a bulky and strange-looking helmut.

<p>"Long story," he gruffed.  "Name's Gnashuphagnewtognius Gnarly.  But you can call
me Gnash.  Probably a lot easier to say Gnash, too, than my full name, and definitely
a lot easier to spell."  He winked at me, and something about his visage reminded me of
a friend in days past.

<p>"Greetings, Gnash," I ventured.  "My name is Amber.  Thank you for coming to my aid."

<p>"No, thank <em>you</em>," Gnash offered.  "I've been waiting around all night for
a little excitement and a pretty face."  I'm sure the alarm showed on my face, for the
dwarf blushed, or at least, the part of his face that wasn't covered with beard blushed,
and he stammered, "Uh, I mean, excitement as in, bar fight, and, uh, <em>ahem</em>, a
pretty face, as in, well, yours."  At this point he turned around to the bar, and
almost squeaked out, "Jack!  I need a drink!  Make it a big one!"

<p>"Allow me to purchase your drink for you," I offered, making my way closer to the bar.
"It would be my pleasure."  This dwarf was intriguing, and he seemed honest enough.
<em>"Why not?"</em> I thought to myself.  <em>"Even if it can't help, it certainly won't
hurt."</em>

<p>Leaning one elbow on the planked bar, rubbed smooth with the elbows and tears of many,
Gnash turned to me.  I noticed that his feet didn't touch the floor from his perch on the
bar stool.

<p>"Well, Miss Amber, it would be <em>my</em> pleasure to drink a free drink bought by
you.  Or anyone, for that matter.  You see, I'm not too particular when it comes to
drinking free spirits."  Jack set down a tall mug of some dark brew, and before moving
on to the next grumbling customers, he decided our conversation was one to which he'd like
to listen.

<p>"You know, I don't usually go around decapitating people.  I'm not even really sure
how it happened.  He just made me angry."

<p>"Remind me not to make you angry," Jack said, laughing.

<p>"Remind <em>me</em> to duck when you start swinging your sword!" Gnash followed.

<p>"You wouldn't have to duck, dwarf," Jack jibed.

<p>"Oh yeah?  Well just for that, I'm not paying my tab!" Gnash countered.

<p>"I thought I was paying your tab," I interrupted.

<p>The rest of the conversation, I am afraid to write, I cannot remember with great
detail.  I remember bits and pieces, points at which I was moved to tears, and times
when I thought my sides would split from laughing so hard.  Suffice it to say, after
five hours of conversation, and twice as many drinks, a friendship had been forged.
