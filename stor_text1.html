<strong><font color="yellow">From the moment he had been transported to
Trassgar from his native world, Stor Restyl had wondered what it was that
made fate lead him and his friends to this strange world.</font></strong>
Of course, at first, he thought he was alone.  By a quirk of magic, Stor had
been separated from his friends, had been captured by a crew of Klaxton Kurl's henchmen,
had been tortured, battered, bruised, and gagged, then had been rescued by Boxer Boy--or
Olen Orfeus or whatever he was calling himself now, Slick, Gargy and a really foxy
elf-woman.
<p>
Now, weeks after his arrival in Trassgar, Stor found himself enjoying
the walk from Furterville back to Forest's Edge, and decided that fate had led him here
for a good reason.  They'd rescued countless villagers and some royalty too, had uncovered
some plots of the bad guy of the land, Klaxton Kurl, and he had even got himself a nifty
ring from the healers at Ice City.  No more falling down cliffs for him!
<p>
All his adventures in Trassgar had taught him one thing, if not more--you have to trust
your friends, and look out for them, as they look out for you.  He surveyed
the group of friends, old and new, who walked ahead of him.  There was his best
friend Olen, trying to impress Scurge with his cantrips.  Ahead of them walked Gnash
and Amber, whom he guessed were as close as siblings could be, except oddly enough, she
was an elf--a high elf, to boot--and he was a gruff dwarf.  He thought he saw Amber pull Gnash's
scraggly hair, and to her delight he turned and fired a withering look at Olen.  Olen of course,
flashed Gnash a look of pure innocence, which was of course, easy to do since he had not taken part
in the trickery.  Gnash grumbled some unintelligible dwarven phrase.  Stor had a feeling he
was better off not understanding it.  And then, Stor always
made sure he kept an eye or two on Gargamel.  Even now Gargy was trying to pick the pockets
of the crazy barbarian, just so he could get poor Slahm into wondering how his
money pouch had vanished again.  <em>Olen'll probably get blamed for that one too,</em> Stor
mused.  Slahm never understood how though his money pouch always disappeared and reappeared,
he never actually lost any money.  Perhaps Gargy was just practicing, or perhaps he was too
kind for a thief.  These moments of respite from the dangers of their tasks, both past and future,
gave them hope and unity.  They needed these fleeting spells of warmth and fun--to prepare them
for the trials ahead.  
<p>
Yes, the journeys had taken them all through so much together.  Most recently, however,
he wondered how it was that they had overtaken the invaders at the Castle of The Third
House so easily.  The folks they'd rescued were terribly grateful, and had let
them stay a while to recuperate and regain their strength.  But it all seemed too good, too
simple.  <em>Maybe I'm just becoming jaded and suspicious,</em> Stor thought, and
involuntarily his mind began wandering to all of the reasons he had to be just that.
<p>
It all started so innocently.  If only they hadn't been so curious; but then, Stor couldn't say
that he wanted to erase the past adventures.  So maybe that ring of pink mushrooms was a blessing,
a virtual gateway to manhood, something that had previously eluded Stor, Slahm, Olen, Slick, and
Gargamel.  Whatever its significance, it marked the beginning of a whole new life for the
adventuring quintet.  <em>I'm just glad that they came and rescued me,</em> Stor thought, <em>Only
my luck would put me, alone, in the middle of a horde of black sashes, and put the others together
in some safe little town.</em>  But, that was in the past.  Only he still had nightmares about the
beatings and torture from those days of imprisonment.  Thank the gods, the other four had made
sure he was found, in part by enlisting the assistance of a mysterious she-elf with an attitude
and a burly dwarf with a strange sense of humor.
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
Before too long, Stor and his compatriots had come upon the Lanagg River, but not by means
of the well-traveled roads between Furterville, through the mining town of Himm
and on to Forest's Edge.  Amber had said it would be safer to venture through the plains
and forests.  Being an elven ranger gave her twice the authority in pathfinding, and the
rest of them had readily agreed.  She knew of an old rope-bridge over the river that was not
used much in recent times because of the more sturdy wooden bridges the dwarves had constructed
further to the east.
<p>
They could see not far ahead the edge of the canyon carved by the river, and the through the
trees Stor could make out this side of the rope bridge.  They paused at the edge of the forest
and surveyed the clearing between them and the bridge.  It was a good minute's jog at best to
the river.
<p>
"Well, gentlemen, pack your gear tightly, and make sure all of your loose items are secured.  If
you drop something into the river, it's lost forever," Amber stated.
<p>
"Could we be any MORE obvious?" Olen muttered grudgingly.
<p>
"Olen!" Scurge hissed.
<p>
Stor chuckled as Amber looked sidelong at Olen.  Whether or not she heard him he couldn't tell,
but if she did, she made no rebuttal.  They had always been at odds, but it seemed that they
enjoyed the rivalry.  The others weren't quite brave enough to intervene.  To make a red-headed
elf and a quirky wizard angry at the same time... well, even Slahm had more brains than that.
<p>
Stor looked up to see Gnash flash across the bridge.  He hadn't even noticed that he'd left
their company.  "One down and seven to go, eh Olen?" Stor joked as he slung his bow over
his head and shoulder, and made sure he was wearing his ring.
<p>
"Seven?" came Olen's puzzled reply.  He was busily packaging his favorite spell components.
<p>
"Sure.  Slahm counts as at least two, don't you think?" Stor and Olen laughed together.  Stor
quickly glanced at the half-orc Slahm to make sure he hadn't heard the snide remark.  He hadn't.
He was trying to figure out how to tie down the boulders he carried as Gargamel tried to convince
him he could always leave them and find other ones.  Meanwhile, Slahm's falcon-in-training
sat patiently on the big half-man's shoulder, ruffling his feathers.
<p>
Each set off for the bridge after they readied their belongings.  By the time Stor reached
the bridge, Amber and Slahm and joined Gnash on the other side, and Gargamel was on his
way across.  Stor gripped the ropes with his gloved hands.  <em>Seems sturdy enough, I
suppose.</em>  He looked down.  Not a terribly long drop, but flashbacks of his past tumbles
down various cliffs haunted him.
<p>
"Don't look down, human," Olen said seriously.
<p>
"Right.  Don't look down," Stor repeated aloud.  He reassuringly tensed his right fist
and felt the pressure of the metal ring on his index finger.  He started across, and
tried not to look down.  The bridge creaked, groaned, and stretched with the added weight.
Ahead, he could see that it also swayed with the wind swirling in the canyon.
<p>
When he was almost half-way across, Stor suddenly stopped.  Sweating profusely,
he swallowed hard.  <em>Is that
Olen cracking his knuckles behind me, or is that the sound that rope makes...</em>
<p>
POP!  <em>...when it snaps!</em>
<p>
The bridge suddenly jolted as one of the bottom supports started to give way to age,
the elements, and the weight it was trying to hold.  Stor looked down, despite himself,
and saw that another rope was unraveling only steps in front of him.
He looked up again, and shouted to Gargamel.
<p>
"Book it!  This bridge is about to collapse!"  The archer attempted to turn around and
retreat to the other side of the bridge, and could see Olen gasping with disbelief.  Scurge
had barely begun her traversal of the canyon herself.  <em>At least we thought to spread
out!  Not spread out enough, I guess!</em>
<p>
With the snap of the second support, the remaining quickly unraveled.  Scurge jumped for the
edge <font color="yellow">[dex check: 12 Yea!]</font>
before the bridge fell from under her, but Olen and Stor plunged toward the rocky shores
below as the bridge split and the ends hung in shambles on either side of the canyon.
<p>
It was magic that brought Stor to this land which had continually put him through peril,
and it was now magic that saved him.  As the frayed ropes slipped past his feet, he
felt the pull of gravity very suddenly, and he tumbled forward.  Then, just as suddenly
as Stor lost his footing, the magic of his ring cushioned his fall through mid air and
he felt as if he were riding the breeze.  Before he could enjoy the sensation, he heard
a terrified scream from above.  Olen Orpheas!
<p>
Stor raised his head and arms instinctively, and saw his wizard friend falling straight for
him.  His next instinct was to get out of the way, but having no grounding, he was helpless
to avoid the fast-falling mass of robes, spell components, and half-elf.  He reached for
Olen <font color="yellow">[dex check: 4 Yea!]</font> and took hold of his friend.  <em>Will
the magic of this ring hold us both?</em> Stor wondered to himself.  <em>And, will I be able
to hold Olen?</em>  <font color="yellow">[str check: 19 Doh!]</font>
<p>
Olen uttered a muffled cry as his downward plunge was suddenly halted, but only briefly,
as Stor could not retain his grip.  As he slipped past Stor, Olen grabbed for his legs.
<font color="yellow">[dex check: 20 Double Doh!]</font>  To Stor and Olen's double dismay,
Stor's pants begin to rip, and before anything could be done, Olen Orpheas and Stor's pants were
falling to their mutual doom.  Stor looked down with panic until he realized that by this point,
the river shore was a mere eight lengths below them.  
<p>
Olen hit the ground <font color="yellow">[1d6 dam/10 lengths: 1pt]</font>, bruising his right
side on the rocks, but without the feared SPLAT. As he looked up he saw Stor smiling at him and
gliding down to join him.  On the opposite canyon rim, Amber, Gnash, and Slahm looked
down with relief, and then averted their gaze to Gargamel, who was scaling the remains of the 
rope bridge to join them. <font color="yellow">[climb roll: 21% yea!]</font>  Looking toward his
own side of the canyon, Stor could see the fringes of what he recognized to be Scurge, fumbling
through a pack--no doubt searching for some rope.
<p>
After recovering all parties from the canyon floor, the group, separated by an turbulent and 
uncrossable river, decided to make their way to Forest's Edge in two groups.  The first to 
arrive was to get supplies and rest at HQ in the High Safe Inn until the others arrived.  Stor
guessed that he, Olen and Scurge would reach Forest's Edge after the others, since they had to
journey downriver until they found a place to cross before journeying onward.
<p>
With a final
wave to their friends across the river, Stor turned to Olen and Scurge.  <em>"Some
shortcut!"</em> he thought, and then said to Olen and Scurge, "Well, lovebirds, now that the 
shortcut saved us all that time, I guess we better find another bridge to cross."
