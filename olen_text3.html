<p>
In the light of a fire suddenly blazingly hot to Olen Orpheas,
the young wizard perceived his evil past and his precarious future in the
grasp of one sinister force, that of Abath.
<p>
Abath stood proudly, his long elven arm extended out to Olen with stretched,
gnarled fingers grasping towards him.
<p>
"Come with me, Orpheas."
<p>
The flames whipped up into a blazing inferno in a sudden wind,
thriving in the warm forest air.
<p>
Abath’s mouth opened to demand one more time Olen’s obedience,
when a disturbance in the brush surprised both elven wizards.
<p>
A short, lanky peasant calmly burst from the surrounding brush.
His clothes were ragged, his hair disheveled, and his face caked with the mud
and grime of mining work.
<p>
"Lanaag Post.  I’m looking for Lanaag post."
<p>
"Away old man!  Before I-"
<p>
"Now come on chap."  The peasant interrupted Abath’s fierce tone.
"There’s no need to be rude.  I was just looking for Lanaag P-"
<p>
Olen didn’t need any more time to formulate his plan.
<p>
The young wizard ran.
<p>
He tucked his trusty staff under left arm and shoved his right hand down his
pocket.
<p>
Abath was internally furious.  He immediately dashed after Orpheas,
swinging his staff and shoving the peasant aside, his speed undaunted
by hundreds of years of existence.  The peasant picked himself up,
and dusted off his filthy pants.
<p>
Olen ran as fast as he could, but at the same time muttering well-remembered
words under his breath.  As he approached the last phrase of the intonation,
he ripped his hand out of his deep coat pocket.  Between his index
and middle fingers he held a tangled spiderweb.  <I>"Kalah!"</I>
<p>
Instantly the air around him fizzled and condensed.  His ears popped
as the pressure changed and the air became thick with a foamy white wet mist.
<font color="yellow">[Olen successfully casts Wall of Fog spell, creating
a 30x30x30 cube of thick fog.]</font>
<p>
As Abath dashed after Olen he immediately began an intonation of his own.
<font color="yellow">[Abath prepares a
<font color="orange"><strike>W</strike>w</font>all of his own- Wall of
Force]</font>
He extended his staff in front of him and finished the semantic as the air
was flooded with thick mist: <I>"Ptai!"</I>
<p>
Olen smacked right into the ethereal brick was with a definitive <I>Oooff!</I>.
<font color="yellow">[Olen takes 4 damage from the impact.  Dexterity
check to stay on his feet- 18- Gah!]</font>  Olen staggered backwards,
his entire front side smarting from the magical sting of an invisible wall,
and collapsed to the ground.
<p>
Abath heard Olen’s breath forcibly expelled from his chest and homed in on the
sound.  In a few more lengthy elven strides he was nearly on top of the dazed
young wizard, the fog severely limiting even his mastered senses.
<p>
Abath reached down and grabbed Olen roughly by the slack of his robes,
lifting him to his feet.  Olen’s head rolled freely backwards and he groaned.
<p>
"Orpheas!  You will come with me!"
<p>
Abath turned only to come face to face with the peasant.
Abath’s lip curled with anger.
<p>
"Lanaag Post, friend.  I’m looking for Lanaag Post."
<p>
"OUT OF MY WAY, VERMIN MAN CHILD!"  Abath dropped Olen who dizzily collapsed
to the ground, and struck out violently with his wooden staff against the
peasant’s scrawny chest.
<p>
The wooden staff's end splintered against the man’s spindly frame, bouncing
so solidly that Abath himself was visibly shocked.   Pieces of the staff
flew off into the foggy darkness.
<p>
The peasant smiled and gripped the remaining staff tightly.  Abath took a
nervous step backwards as his mouth opened slowly.
<p>
<font color="yellow">["Peasant" <font color="orange"><strike>casts a

<p>
Before Abath’s eyes the wirey miner transformed, large golden wings
appearing out of his back, clothes vanishing, and grim<font
color="orange">e</font>-filled fingers
magically becoming foot-long dragon-sized talons.
<p>
Eebnox Zorbulussinificcipid ripped Abath’s broken staff out of his grasp
and tossed it into the woods, then pumped his giant wings.  In one,
powerful gust of drac-inspired wind, the fog was blown skyward.  Eebox
arched his long neck downward toward a stunned Abath, and roared a furious
dragon roar that shook the trees around the forest.
<p>
<font color="yellow">[Initiative, perhaps?  Don’t mind if I do!

<p>
Eebnox struck first.  In a swift and perfectly choreographed attack,
<font color="yellow">[THAC0(9)-AC(2)=7.  Rolls 20, 15, 18.  Ouch!]</font>
Eebnox ripped open twin tracks of flesh in Abath’s torso and rammed his large
dragonish skull into Abath’s chest,
sending the dark elf flying through the
woods and sliding across the leaf-covered forest floor.
<p>
Olen effortlessly released three <font color="yellow">[one for every odd
level... 5th level = 3 missiles]</font> magic missiles, which weaved and zoomed
between trees until they found their target on Abath’s abused body.
<font color="yellow">[d4+1 each- 3+3+4=10... Yikes!!]</font>
<p>
Needless to <font color="orange"><strike>say</strike> mention</font>,
Abath’s sophisticated polymorph spell fizzled as he mumbled the spell,
and he slid to a stop against a huge tree trunk, and uprighted himself,
blood dripping from smiling lips.
<p>
<font color="yellow">[Combat round 2 begins.  Eebnox will lunge forward for
another physical melee.  Olen reaches for his bag of crystals and prepares
for his Chromatic Orb <I>(dun dun dunnnn…)</I> spell.  Abath decides to

Initiative: Olen 5, Abath 5, Eebnox 6]</font>
<p>
<font color="orange">Suddenly, before Olen's eyes,</font> Abath vanished
in a soft gleam of light.  <font color="orange">Elsewhere</font>, standing,
Abath moved instinctually for his spell components, a tiny bit of sulphur
and some bat guano mixed together.
<p>
Olen and Eebnox rapidly turned and looked for a similar flash in all directions,
where they saw it twenty yards behind them.  The great dragon lurched around
in a wide circle and roared again, dwarfing Olen, who<font color="orange">,
<strike>[mutters some enchantments and reaches for a red-tinted
crystal]</strike> muttering some enchantments and reaching for a red-tinted

confident "Kalah!"  <font color="orange"><strike>Olen</strike> He</font>

color="orange">could</font> see that<font color="orange"></font>
Abath <font color="orange">had</font> teleport<font color="orange">ed</font>
away.
<p>
Eebnox lunged into the air, his wingspan clearing down several trees, and
headed toward the bloodied elf.
<font color="orange"><strike>Unfortunately,</strike></font>
<p>
<font color="yellow">[Combat round 3.  Eebnox decides to rush Abath again.
Olen has lost his view of Abath thanks to the gargantuan dragon so he decides
to flank Abath through the trees and use his free hand to send another volley
of magic missiles.  Abath is only a mystic incantation away from his Fireball
spell. Initiative: Abath 2, Olen 3, Eebnox 6]</font>
<p>
Abath readjusted himself on the tree he was leaning against and muttered
something quickly as the dragon closed the distance on him.
<font color="orange">Seconds later, Olen performed the casting of the magic
missile spell, hoping against hope his magic would complete before the
spell he could clearly see Abath summoning.  Just as Olen completed the
motions for the spell, <strike>Suddenly</strike></font> a huge fireball
erupted from Abath’s hands and sped toward Olen.
<p>
Eebnox realized the giant fireball’s final trajectory and thought
quickly <font color="orange"> to himself.</font>  <em>"Olen would
surely not survive such a tremendous attack."</em>  <font color="orange">
<strike>Eebnox’s</strike> His</font> giant, ancient frame flexed and prepared
for pain as he altered his flight path and extended his wings.
<p>
<font color="orange">To Olen's horrified surprise,</font>
Eebnox planted his massive hind claws firmly into the ground in front of the
racing fireball.
<p>
<I>WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOSH</I>
<p>
<font color="yellow">[Eebnox fails saving throw intentionally and takes 13d6
points of damage.  (Abath is EXP level 13).  41 hit points total, however.
Eebnox being the golden dragon he is has an innate partial resistance to
fire attacks, and is protected from 13 of those points of damage.  28 total.
96-28=68 hit points left]</font>
<p>
<font color="orange">Half crouched in an attempt to dodge Abath's oncoming
fire, and eyes wide with an almost empathic pain at seeing the dragon absorb
the full power of Abath's fire, Olen trusted that his
<strike>Olen’s</strike></font> trio of shimmering
white magic bolts slammed into Abath<font color="orange">, who was
momentarily</font> prone from releasing the fireball spell.
<font color="yellow">[4+2+4=10 more points of damage: uh oh...]</font> 
<font color="orange">His vision blocked by the golden dragon,
Olen could not see that his magic missiles had</font>
spun the aged elf to the ground.
<p>
Eebnox’s golden scales seared in the heat as the flames lept above and
below--but not beyond--the ancient dragon’s wings.  He had succeeded in
containing the fireball spell--but Eebnox’s dragon mind feared that the evil
one could summon another fireball as quickly as he made the last appear.
<p>
<font color="yellow">[Combat round 4.  Olen is in shock.  Eebnox is angry.
Abath is panicking.  Initiative: Olen 1, Eebnox 7, Abath 8]</font>
<p>
"No!!!" Olen screamed from behind the dragon, whom he was <font
color="orange">now</font> sure was the same
golden dragon that had given him golden-laced eyes.   He remembered vividly
the dragon’s words that fateful night in the
<font color="orange"><strike>castle</strike> cave underneath Himm
mountain</font> that the dragon would accompany Olen on his journeys always and
would be there in his time of most dire need.
<p>
This seemed like as good a time of dire need as any Olen could think of.  He
just hoped it didn’t get this beautiful dragon killed.  Could this be the
dragon Scurge dreamt about?  His memory of that time was <font
color="orange"><strike>so</strike></font> sketchy<font color="orange">--and
he did not realize that the reason was that <strike>with</strike></font>
Abath’s mental shroud <font color="orange">was</font> clouding his mind up
until very recently.
<p>
As Olen ran <font color="orange">cautiously around the dragon, and</font>
towards Abath the dragon violently extended his neck forward and a vortex
of greenish gas erupted from the dragon's mouth.
<font color="yellow">[Just for numbers sake... Abath needs an 8 to save vs.
Spell and gets 7.  Abath receives the full 68 points of damage, placing the
evil wizard at the -66 hit point mark.]</font> Olen covered his nose and mouth
with his thick cloak and stopped running quickly as the tree Abath was
collapsed against was flooded with poison gas.  As the fumes from the attack
rifled through Olen’s nose and eyes, <font color="orange"><strike>Olen</strike>
he</font> kept his vision fixated on the fallen wizard’s position.
Through the thick cloud he spied peaks at Abath’s body, still and motionless,
propped up against a tree.
<p>
The cloud of gas cleared, and Olen saw that his unused Chromatic Orb was
useless.  He looked at the glowing ball of magic in his hand and extinguished
it like a candle with a small puff of air.
Eebnox craned his neck and turned to Olen, whom he found not far behind him.
<p>
Olen moved quickly into the dissipating haze to Abath, drawn by a innate
sense of morbidity and closure. He neared Abath’s body, seeing the horrid
disfiguration the poison gas has done to Abath’s face.  To Olen’s disgust,
Abath moved his head to look up at Olen through grossly distorted eyes.
<p>
"Orpheas..." Abath coughed weakly, shaking his entire ruined frame.
<p>
He smiled.  "Remember the Arbyr?"
<p>
Searing anger and hatred tore into Olen, as, with his dying breathes,
Abath reminded Olen of the mass culling Orpheas had once imparted upon an
entire race of gnomes.
<p>
"How does it feel... after so long?" Abath bitingly added through an atonal
rasp.
<p>
Olen, striken by uncontrollable anger, dropped to his knees and grabbed Abath
by the shoulders.  But the ancient elven wizard was dead.
A slight glimmer was expelled from the evil ones eyes, and Olen found himself
clenching the mystic patterned runes on Abath’s robes--dark elven runes he had
not noticed before.  Olen released Abath’s clothes, stood up, and backed
forcefully away from the corpse.  He felt dirty, his hands, evil,
and wiped his palms on his own robes as if to wash them off.
He turned away from Abath, and never looked back.
<p>
Olen approached the mysterious golden dragon.
<p>
Without moving, Eebnox projected his thoughts into Olen’s head.
<I>"I am Eebnox Zorbulussinificcipid, the very dragon you helped save one day
from my most dire time of need.  My debt is now repaid to you... but I feel a
special bond to you, elfhuman.  You are ancient, like I am, but paradoxically
young.  Your mind is fresh and young but hardened now, your magic is growing
as fast as your wisdom."</I>
<p>
Olen replied, as best he could<font color="orange">, not having communicated
telepathically before.</font>
<p>
<I>"Your wounds, are they serious?"</I>
<p>
<I>"Nothing a few centuries won’t heal, elfhuman.  I am fortunate to have
found you when I did.  At first I was not convinced of the intentions of the
one named Lutanian D’Abath D’Lenlowy.  I had detected his forced entry
to this world and it drew the attention of even the Spheric Beings.  I am
glad his threat to this world and yours is ended."</I>
<p>
<I>"Spheric Beings?"</I> <font color="orange">Olen thought, puzzled.  Then,
</font> Olen suddenly felt an overwhelming emotion, translated not through
sound or speech but pure telepathic vibrations.  It made his entire body
shiver and his hands stretch out to their limit.  Olen raised his eyebrows.
The ground beneath him shuddered with the deepest vibration he’d ever sensed.
<p>
He felt a dragon laugh.
<p>
It was incredible<font color="orange">!</font>
<p>
<I>"You have much to learn of the cosmos, elfhuman. I must express my
pleasure of having exchanged telepathy with you.  It is the first response
I have received from a humanoid in several millenia."</I>
<p>
<I>"I can only thank you, Dragon.  Your kind has always been a mystery to my
people.  I am honored.</I>
<p>
<I>"Your species too has been a mystery to all.  I gather from what you are,
that you species is a noble and promising one.  You reflect the best
attributes your nature has to offer, despite your past, elfhuman."</i>
<font color="orange">Eebnox shifted his weight, and his expression sombered.
</font> <i>"I feel
I must leave you now.  You must rejoin your friends and return home.</I>
<p>
<i>"Agreeably, wise one, I must rejoin my friends in Forest’s Edge.  But
I cannot return home.  It would be so hard for me."</i>
<p>
The giant dragon swelled up as if to fly, but continued their telepathic link.
<p>
<I>"I <font color="orange"><strike>am afraid because of my duties as a
near-immortal and my clairvoyant abilities I cannot</strike> wish I could</font>
tell you what lies ahead of you,"</i> Eebnox said with a sigh, both mental
and physical.  <i>"The future is a chase.  We constantly run after it;
we never catch it, yet we are bound to follow its path, which is the present.
But one thing you must understand is that one day, as hard as it will be,
you must return home.  It is your place."</I>
<p>
Olen sighed and straightened his robes.  Scurge and Stor would be waking soon,
<font color="orange"><strike>for</strike> and</font> the light of dawn would
break in an hour or so.
<p>
<I>"Will I see you again, Dragon?"</I> Olen queried.
<p>
<I>"Your golden eyes are a symbol of our eternal connection.
<font color="orange">In a way, you will always see me, and I you, as we view
life through a sliver of each other's eyes.</font>
<strike>Your children will carry your them, your grandchildren will carry
them.  For</strike> As I am nearly immortal so shall the be the marks you
carry in your magic.  <font color="orange">Just as magic has closely knitted
together a part of our lives, so perhaps are our futures,</font>  <strike>As
our magicks are now closely knitted so are our futures;</strike> for magic
and the future are often intertwined in a spiraling waterfall the Spheric
Beings call the Strands of Eternity.  And as for seeing me, I am not as
bonded to the empirical senses as your kind is, so that is not a concern for
me.  But I promise that you or anyone who carries your golden eyes will
never fail to notice the scales of a dragon.</I>
<p>
With that, Eebnox extended his wings and rose up into the <font
color="orange"><strike>late night</strike> pre-dawn</font> sky.
<font color="orange">Olen Orpheas' thoughts were again for no one save
himself, and in them he pondered the dragons prophesies.

<p>
"Olen, are you sure you didn’t want to even look at what Abath might have had
under his robes?" Stor asked.  <font color="orange">Olen had returned to their
camp, where the fire was exhausting itself as Scurge and the archer stretched
from their forced sleep.</font>
<p>
"Yes, I am.  I would not want any of his dark elven magic on me.
I could not stand to use his magic."
<p>
"Are you sure?<font color="orange">" Stor asked innocently.  "</font>I mean,
we could probably fetch a good price--"
<p>
"I’m positive Stor.  Light it up.  Let’s get this over with,
and get to Forest’s Edge."
