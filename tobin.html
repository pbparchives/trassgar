T'Asha's history is unknown to all dungeoneers at this point.

<p>
T'Asha busied herself with the incense in the main chamber.  The fine embers
still held the faint glow of hours past, but even that was dwindling away.
It seemed that she was rekindling the flames of the <em>Ikra</em> more often
these days, almost as if something supernatural was draining the substance of
the fragrant spice sticks more quickly.  Whatever the cause, this was the third time
this month she had rekindled the fires and added the precious oils and spice
to the urns.<p>
She brushed a wisp of wavy hair from her forehead, leaving a damp trail of
incense and oil, still concentrating on the task at hand.  As she prayed over
the last urn and kindled its blue fire, she heard the chamber doors open in
the distance.  "<em>Strange,</em>" she thought quizzically, "<em>Who else would
be awake at this hour?</em>"<p>
She did not have to wait long for her answer, she realized, as the curtains
separating the main assembly chamber from the holy center parted and The Third
entered the shrine.<p>
"Holy One.  Good Light to you.  How may I be of service?"
<p>
"Good Light, T'Asha.  We are alone, are we not?" She paused as T'Asha nodded.
"Then let us be as we always have been.  How are you feeling, my cousin?"<p>
T'Asha visibly relaxed and a sadness swept over her countenance.  "I am not
well, S'Asha.  Better, yes, but not well.  When should I expect for this weight
to be lifted?  It has been many lights, and yet, I still mourn for him."<p>
"Many times these hurts ever go away.  You know this to be true.  You must only
allow the pain to diminish enough for you to honor him and the Great Light with
your service.  Anyone who directs you to cease mourning after a time has never
truly experienced a paired-stroll in the Great Light."  She paused, searching
T'Asha for a sign of the raging storm within beginning to calm.  T'Asha looked
up, her shoulders strong and high.  S'Asha smiled her approval and reaching
her arm around her cousin's shoulder.  "You are
a strong reflection of the Great Light, my child.  Mk'Asha is very proud of
you; of that you can be sure."<p>
The familiar sound of the Chamber doors opening and echoing their reluctance
ended their private conversation.  "Come out into the Main Assembly Chamber,
Seventy-third.  We have much to discuss with you."  And with a wink and a smile,
S'Asha led the way into the meeting that would change Tobin Ashara's young life
forever.<p>

<span class="dm">
T'Asha followed her cousin into the Main Assembly Chamber, and they walked
up to a gathering of several members of the higher-ordered Ikran priests
and priestesses of Kahdyr.</span>
They were seated around a simple wooden table partially
hidden in the shadows of the candle-lit room, and all had their chairs turned toward
the doorway through which Seventy-third and The Third had passed.  The priests rose from
their seats and walked to meet them presently, as if they were waiting for T'Asha's
arrival.
<p>
"The Evening Light finds us with much to do, Seventy-third," began Q'Lesta,
The First.  "Please, clear your mind of all anxiety."  Q'Lesta, one of the Kahdyr Ikran
ceremonial leaders, easily could see
the wrinkled forehead which betrayed T'Asha's puzzlement.
<p>
With a few slow breaths, eyes closed, T'Asha tried to be at calm with the gathering
of the elders of her home.  Talking with S'Asha--The Third--was one matter, as she
knew her cousin outside of her rank and duties of the Ikran Order.  But to be a part
of a meeting of the high priests and priestesses in the middle of the night gave
her an uneasy feeling.  A feeling she swept away with calm images she now conjured
in her mind.
<p>
"I have been summoned for an important reason," T'Asha offered.  She noticed that
the arrangement of candles was set for a ceremony.  <em>"A ritual service of commission,"</em>
she thought to herself.
<p>
"We have a field commission for you, Tobin Ashara," The First continued.  T'Asha
stole a quick look toward her cousin, who stood there with a knowledgeable smile
on her countenance.  "Are your mid-night duties finished?"
<p>
T'Asha nodded.
<p>
"Then we will begin."  Please, have a seat.  The priests walked toward the center of
the assembly hall, and surrounded a plain wooden chair in the middle of the arrangement
of the candle-laden pedestals.
<p>
S'Asha observed with joy in her heart as her cousin was commisioned as a warrior of the Light. 
It had been many days since she had had room in her heart for the joy she now felt; too often
it had been burdened with the tragedies of days past.  But to see the maturing
and healing of T'Asha had renewed in her a new hope that things would not be as dark as she
had foreseen.
<p>
As the candlelight glimmered on the hilt of T'Asha's newly commissioned sword and her
carefully polished armor, S'Asha gasped.  A array of images flooded forth in her consciousness
and she shook as she recalled the knowledge of the visions that had been bombarding her
mind. <em>It was T'Asha!  It was T'Asha... </em>
<p>
As the First retrieved a scroll case from her robes and delivered it over to T'Asha,
T'Asha stole a glance at her cousin, and in doing so glimpsed a look of revelation and shock on
S'Asha's face.  But due to
the overwhelming and serious nature of the ceremony she was involved in, she paid it little
mind.  The scroll case was thick, and the
weight of its contents felt good in T'Asha's hand when she was handed it.
"You must carry this scroll to one of our brothers, by name of Blint Irna,
who lives three days' walk west of here.
He is a priest of the Ikra, but desires to live apart from the Kahdyr Order in
an isolated dwelling near Stomerd Lake.  From time to time, we send word of the state
of the Kahdyr elves and the knowledge we have gained, and in return he sends to us scrolls of
his studies and the happenings of north central Trassgar.  He is a wise, old, gentle he-elf,
and his quest for knowledge and truth surprisingly flourishes in his isolation.  The library
he has set up there is filled with ancient texts and arcane writings which he has gathered,
or written, and studies with constant diligence."
<p>
The elves gathered all paused for T'Asha's reaction.  "I will go as you ask, and spread
The Light in my path before me."  T'Asha bowed her head slightly, proudly accepting the
commission.
<p>
The First spoke up.  "The journey will not be an easy one.  In fact, your commission has an
second task.  Fifty-first was sent west three weeks ago to contact the roving halfling
band under the clan leadership of Syona Onearm.  His band routinely provides us with news
from the southern regions of our land.  Fifty-first should have returned by now with news of
the halflings' journeys.  His absence concerns us, as do the reports of trouble in the
form of a rebel warlord in Central Trassgar."  The First paused, glanced at her elven
colleagues, and returned her gaze to T'Asha.  "After you exchange scrolls with Bl'Irna,
assuming you do not encounter Syona's clan on the way, we want you to journey south and find
Fifty-first, or where he has gone.  Once you enter halfling lands, if they are in the area,
they will contact you.  You will be recognized by your Ikran armor, and they will show
you hospitality."
<p>
T'Asha felt proud to be given the dual-commission.  She had expected to be sent out one
day on a quest to prove herself, but not one this soon, and not one of this importance.
She recalled her conversation with Seventy-first, who was sent to Furterville with a company
of young elves for the annual Blessing Festival.  How she longed to see that famed city; how
she hoped that her first commission would send her there, too.  Now, she wondered what stories
she would tell upon her return.  Then, T'Asha realized that The First had not mentioned any
traveling companions.
<p>
"Am I to journey alone?" she asked matter-of-factly.  She did not wish to sound as if she
needed accompaniment, but at the same time, she hoped she would have it.  Again, she glanced at
her cousin, who deferred any response she might have offered to The First.
<p>
"Yes, Seventy-third.  This journey will be a true test of your dual-studies.  Your priestly
study will prepare you for your no-doubt fascinating conversations with Bl'Irna, and
your warrior training will aid you in your search for Fifty-first.  To add a third component,
a traveling companion, would only make easier this test, your commission.  Also, we believe
that in finding Fifty-first, you will have better success alone."
<p>
With that, the priests began filing out from behind the table, forming a circle around T'Asha,
chanting and praying.  A great warmth filled T'Asha, and she felt her hands tingle as the hilt
of her sword molded to the shape of her small hand, and the armor she had been adorned with
contoured itself to fit her joints and curves.  Her ring began to glow with a bright light, and
she saw visions of the conquest of evil and the blood of their enemies...  and when she looked up
again, she was alone, accompanied only by the candelight dancing in the tiny cracks of the stone
walls.

<p>

Without asking, T'Asha knew that she was to leave immediately, once she packed
a small bag of necessities.  She glanced around the temple once more before
she departed, drawing strength from the holiness and warmth of the stone walls.
<em>"I will return,"</em> she said to herself, knowing it and feeling it
within herself.  "Good Light.." she whispered, and then disappeared into the
darkness.
<p>
By the time dawn began to sneak onto the horizon, Tobin Ashara was well
outside of the Ikran Commune, and even the surrounding village.  The trees
seemed to sway with her as she moved toward Stomerd Lake.  <em>"Strange,"</em>
she thought as she watched the furry giants billow and creak,
<em>"their sounds used to be so frightening.  The cracking and
popping in the wind appeared a show of force, and the creaking of the limbs a
kind of menacing groan."</em>  The trees now seemed to shelter her, and sing
a song of travel.  <em>"I have changed so much since you died, my love.  How
I hope that you can see my new peace and greater purpose!"</em>  The birds
began to awaken, chirping a lively melody.
<p>
Midday brought passage through a tiny community of woodland elves, traders
and blacksmiths and tapestry weavers.  T'Asha was continually impressed by
those that chose this life of isolation.  She knew that their communication
with nature and dependence on it gifted them and found its way into their work.
There could be no doubt of this, as she admired swords that looked as if they
were a natural extension of an arm and blankets that seemed to sing a lullaby
with their swirling pattern of colors.
<p>
"Priestess, priestess!" a small voice called, as a little girl ran hard to
catch T'Asha before she disappeared into the wood again.  "Mama wants to know
if you would allow us to offer you lunch."
<p>
"Well, little one, I cannot accept the invitation of one who has no name.  But
let's see, do you have a name?"  Tobin replied, eyes sparkling.
<p>
The look of disappointment quickly disappeared as the girl became a little shy.
"My name is Letha," she said, chancing a small grin as she became keenly
interested in her bare feet.
<p>
"Well, Letha, I would be happy to join you for a midday meal.  Which way
shall we go?"  
<p>
"I'll show you!" she exclaimed, grabbing T'Asha's hand and heading for the
edge of the treeline.
<p>
The small cottage was much larger on the inside than its subtle exterior
foretold.  T'Asha was led into the main family room, where a young elf woman
was stirring a pot of delicious smelling soup over the central fireplace.  To
the left of the front door was another door that led into a bedroom, and to
the right was similar, closed door.  The main room was furnished comfortably
with sturdy wood chairs and table, and even a generously cushioned window
bench seat.  "My Mama is a tapestry weaver, the best there is!" Letha offered,
and with that the young woman turned to face her guest.
<p>
"My goodness, Letha, you could have told me you were back!"  And with a smile,
"Welcome to our home, priestess.  My name is Kinhala.  I'm so glad you could
join us!"
<p>
"As am I, Kinhala.  Travelling has made me very hungry for both a hot meal
and some companionship.  I'm afraid the animals of the forest don't care much
for conversation!"  They laughed together.  "Oh, My name is T'Asha."
<p>
"Pleasure to meet you, T'Asha.  I have some hot soup, some fresh bread, and a
cooling smarkendoerry pie.  Does that sound alright?" Kinhala queried,
and with that they sat down to aromatic vittles and conversation about recent
happenings and travellers in the area.

<p>

<span class="dm">Tobin Ashara sank into the cushion of her chair,
content.</span> She smiled at her two hostesses.  Kinhala and
her daughter, Letha, were the most cheerful of company and the food they
offered the most delicious she had tasted in many weeks.  In return for their
hospitality, T'Asha asked if she could see their harvest fields, that she
might invoke a blessing upon them and their harvesters.
<p>
Kinhala sent her daughter ahead to let the farmers know.  "Tell them a
priestess from Kahdyr is going to pay them a visit after a little
while."  Letha was delighted to comply, and rose from the table politely.
<p>
"Excuse me, Miss T'Asha!"  With a curtsey, Letha turned and walked to the
door.  Outside, she turned to a run, shouting, "Daddy! Daddy!  Guess who's
coming to see you?"
<p>
Once Letha had departed, Kinhala's expression sombered a bit, and she
spoke to T'Asha on a subject more serious.  "Tell me, T'Asha, why you have
come to our village."  She noted the puzzlement on the priestess' face,
and continued hurriedly in an attempt to explain.  "Do not think you are
unwelcome.  It is just. . . .  Well, we don't usually see one from your order
traveling alone, and so well-armed.  Usually, your order honors us with
an entourage of clergy, to participate in services, or to have meetings with
the Ashan deacon, or maybe to teach some of the children about
the Great Light.  You don't seem to be here for any of those reasons."
<p>
"No, I am not here to stay for long.  I am on my commission."  T'Asha spoke
with pride and looked down into her lap.  Soon, her expression
turned to one of concern, and she raised her head with a deep sigh that
betrayed the seriousness of her quest, and the importance of her commission.
"I am searching for another of my order who has not returned from his
journeys."
<p>
Certainly, Tobin also was to trade scrolls with Blint, but the
disappearance of Fifty-first--whom she knew informally as Khabil Rines--was
more on her mind.  She reflected a moment on her commission, and how she
was to go about completing it.  Perhaps the townfolk of Ash could aid her?
"Him whom I seek is named Kh'rin, and he may have traveled nearby.
<p>
Kinhala pressed her guest for any details which might be of note, or would
help the elfkin of Ash in Tobin's search.  Tobin described
Fifty-first's appearance and where he most likely had journeyed in his
mission from Kahdyr, to the woods south of Ash, and back to Kahdyr.  She
did not relate with whom the elf was to have met, as his meeting with
Syona Onearm was to remain clandestine.  However, she was at a loss to
suggest how else the town folk of Ash could help her.
<span class="dm">[INT check: 17.  Hmm?]</span>
<p>
"Perhaps we could meet with a representative from our perimeter scouts,"
Kinhala suggested at the conclusion of their talk.
<p>
"I would like that very much," Tobin said with a warm smile.  They rose
from the table, cleared it of the dinner setting, and Tobin gathered her
pack.  When they left the house, the Kahdyr priestess
remembered the blessing she had promised.
Kinhala led her to the fields which her husband helped to tend, and Tobin's
mind gathered the words of the ritual blessing.

<p>

The clearing seemed to appear out
of nowhere as they crossed the stream and reached the rise.
Small patches of vegetable gardens and grain fields filled a valley
surrounded by dense forest.  Elves large and small were working
diligently to weed those crops still in the growing season and harvesting
those that were ripe for picking.  T'Asha scanned the area, taking in
the feel of the place.  The smell of sweat mixed with the air of
accomplishment gave her a satisfied feeling.  The wave of a he-elf broke
her reverie.<p>

As she went to join the group of elves gathering at the base of a large
kijkid tree, she began her prayers.  Most elfkin weren't aware of
the many silent prayers offered up before a blessing.
<span class="dm">[Tobin starts casting the Ikran Fields Blessing,
a level one spell we haven't quite mapped out yet.]</span>
  <em>Light
everlasting, Light that gives life and growth...</em> <p>

"priestess, we're so glad to have you with us today," Jk'ina said,
holding one of his children tenderly in his arms. <p>


"It is my distinct pleasure," T'Asha replied.  <p>

<em>I invoke your Essence to this place.
Touch these plants with a ray of your Light...</em><p>

"What brings you to these parts?" another farmer asked.<p>

Tobin relaxed as the tingling began to move through her.
"I am looking for one of my order" she responded, pleased to see the 
enthusiasm of the elves gathering around her.<p>

<em>Grace these farmers with your wisdom...</em><p>

"I think we're all here now, priestess, if you're ready."<p>

<em>and fill them with the goodness and give them a hunger that neither
 grain nor fruit nor any physical thing can quench.</em><p>

T'Asha smiled.  "I am ready."<p>

"May the true Light shower rains of goodness upon you and your fields,"
Tobin chanted.<p>
"There is only one Great Light" the people responded.<p>
"May the one Light bring a harvest that will feed many,"<p>
"There is only one Great Light"<p>
"May the holy Light grant you peace that you may work to satisfy your
hunger, and hunger that you may work for peace"<p>
"There is only one Great Light"<p>
"May the pure Light bring these fields, and your hearts, abundance."<p>
"There is only one Great Light"<p>
And with that, Tobin Ashara stretched her hands out over their fields,
and a golden glow began to eminate from the plants.
<span class="dm">[Tobin's spell completes.  The crops here will produce
an increased yield with the same amount of harvesting and tend for the
next month.]</span><p>

She smiled.  Visual evidences of the Great Light were not rare, but neither
were they common.  These people truly had found favor with the Light.  
Perhaps the scouting party would be helpful after all; the Light had a way
of using Its own to further It's good, and as a result, the good of It's
people.  "Your fields have been blessed as a result of your devotion
and belief.
And now, I really should be on my way.  Kinhala, do you think that I could
speak with someone from your scouting party before I go?"<p>

"Of course, priestess.  This way."  And with the farmers calling their
to them, T'Asha waved as they walked back into
the forest, enjoying the happy sounds of children playing and the
thanks and well-wishes of the farmers ringing through the valley.<p>

<p>

<span class="dm">Kinhala of the elven village of Ash led the Ikran
priestess through the tall trees of the enveloping forest.</span>  They
picked their way through low lying branches, around tall hard wood trees
and prickly bushes.  Tobin followed her host and guide for a few minutes
whereupon they discovered another clearing.  Neither elf thought it strange
that there were no paths carved or beaten into the density of the forest
trees and foilage between clearings.  In fact, the first race preferred
to leave as much of the native plants and grounds untouched as possible in
an ongoing effort to maintain a respect and a balance with the land.
<p>
There were a few wooden barracks snuggled into the earth in the clearing.
One taller tower stretched upwards into the overhanging branches of the trees,
where it was swallowed up in the leaves and darkness of the shadowy boughs.
Tobin spied movement above her, but no sounds betrayed the presence of any
creatures other than the squirrels and other tree dwellers--exactly the
way the Ashan, and all woodland elves, preferred it.
<p>
There was a solitary elf standing comfortably nearby, and he beckoned them
closer with an upraised arm motion.  "Greetings to you Kinhala, and your
guest of the Ikran Order."  He bowed his head slightly in respect, and shut
his eyes.  Opening them after a moment's hesitation, he spoke to Kinhala.
"Come to tempt us with more of your pastries?"
<p>
"Oh no, not today," came the reply.  "You've had your fill from the look of
you."  Kinhala turned to her guest and introduced her cousin, Jovin, one
of the scouts who routinely traced paths surrounding the community.
<p>
"You have journeyed long today.  I trust Kinhala has given your trip a
welcome respite," Jovin spoke hopefully.
<p>
"Yes, she has.  She even tempted me with one of her pastries."
<p>
"Ah, excellent!  Hope you saved some for the rest of us!"  The three shared a
laugh, but Jovin soon turned the conversation to business, as if he
anticipated the reason for the she-elf' visit.  "What can I do for you,
priestess?"
<p>
Tobin regarded him with an inner smile at having shown her such reverence.
She felt she barely deserved it, especially at her young age.  But she had
taken the vows of the Ikran order, and she herself respected those of like
resolution--why should Jovin be any different?
<p>
Before she could answer, Kinhala took the opportunity to return to her
residence.  She bid them both a good bye, and T'Asha a successful journey.
<p>
When the two elves were alone, Tobin spoke of the long delayed, perhaps
missing priest.  "Have your travels in the surrounding lands brought you
in contact with any of the Ikran Order?" she inquired.
<p>
"I would definitely remember any adorned in the armor of your kindred,
T'Asha," Jovin replied, brow wrinkled slightly.  "And, I have not met with
any such he-elf."  With a reassuring smile, he beckoned T'Asha to one of the
buildings.  "Perhaps one of the other scouts has met with him, no?"
<p>
T'Asha led the way to the nearest barrack where they met with some of the
other scouts.  They reviewed the written logs of the permiter scouts from
the past several weeks.  To T'Asha's dismay, but not to her surprise, none
of the scouts remembered encountering Fifty-First.
Tobin glimpsed two log entries that described meetings with the halflings
who lived in the valleys west of the Ashan forest.  The log noted that the
halflings were in Onearm's clan.
<p>
T'Asha asked about the meetings with the halflings.
One of the elves present was part of the second meeting with the clan.
"Periodically we meet up with Onearm's crew at the eastern border of their
territory," Dkalin offered.  "He didn't speak of any Ikran priest among
them, if that's what you're wondering."
<p>
<span class="dm">[WIS check: 5. made it.]</span>
Tobin Ashara wondered to herself why the scout's words seemed almost defensive,
but she betrayed no emotion.  Feeling she had learned all she was going
to from the scouts, at least through conversation, she made motion to leave.
"Thank you for your help, brothers," T'Asha offered.  "I must continue my
journey and my search."
The scouts bowed their heads slightly in a valedictory gesture, and Jovin
saw her to the door.
<p>
"If you wished it," Jovin spoke as they emerged back into the clearing, "you
could accompany the next scouting party.  We're scheduled to leave in the
morning and we're heading west."  Jovin's eyes were gentle and had the hint
of a question beyond the offer.  "In fact, our travels will takes us
near the lands that Onearm calls his stomping grounds.  I--we could show
you the best path, at least in this humble scout's opinion."  He made an
obviously overacted flourish to accompany his invitation.
<p>
T'Asha considered Jovin's words, and his demeanor as well.
Certainly she was enjoying the friendly scout's company and wouldn't mind the
pleasure of it for a little longer.  She had a hint of feeling for the he-elf,
and she needlessly shamed herself for almost slipping into a friendship
with him.  For a minute she had almost forgotten about her dear Mk'Asha.
Alas, she would not forget him and their life together.  For now, Tobin
steeled herself to turn down Jovin's invitation to travel with him.
The First said her journey was to be a solo one; however, what good
would it do to turn down an offer for help?  T'Asha reconsidered her options
and wondered if she should resume her commission by herself after all.
Furthermore, should she continue on to Bl'Irna, or meet with Onearm and
inquire of Fifty-First with or without the company of the Ashan scouts?

<p>

It would be senseless to refuse help.  If her teachers had taught her one thing, it was that
 staying true to oneself and the Ikra did not mean being blind and stupid.  
<p>
"Thank you, Jovin, I shall gladly accompany you.  It seems that I should meet with Onearm 
myself, and find out as much as I can about the last known whereabouts of Fifty-first."  
<p>
Smiling, Jovin led the way to a sitting place where they could gather and discuss their 
next scouting mission with the others.  Dkalin seemed unhappy that she was accompanying them, only noticeable by the occasional scowl.  She wondered what it was that he knew that he wasn't sharing.

<p>
<span class="dm">Tobin Ashara spent that night in the spare room at Kinhala's
dwelling.</span> Upon finding out that Tobin was to go with the Ashan scouts
in the morning, Kinhala invited her to stay with them, much to the delight of
Letha who barely managed to get to bed before midnight.  The child's excitement
at playing hostess to a priestess of the Ikra infused her with an unnatural
dose of insomnia.  In the morning, Tobin filled her belly with a breakfast
she insited that be allowed to help cook, and said her goodbyes to her the
family.  Letha made her promise to visit again, and Tobin was glad to make
that promise.  T'Asha wondered if all elven children were as insistent as
Letha, and sombered at the thought that she never had the chance to raise
children of her own.

She met up with Jovin and the other Ashan scouts at the western edge of
the town.  Jovin briefly explained the route they were going to take and where
and how soon they expected to meet up with the halflings under Onearm's
leadership.  Tobin was eager to get started, and even more eager to see parts
of Trassgar she had not been to before.  She tried not to slip into frustration
when Jovin told the group that their predetermined meeting place with Onearm
was one day's journey away.  Most of the scouts seemed knowledgeable
of the route and some, including Dkalin, were fidgeting with impatience.  But
there was one scout who was new to this party, so no one said anything
derrogatory about newcomers much to Tobin's relief.  Certainly she could
have handled herself in such a situation, but she was glad all the same that
it did not present itself.
</p>
<p>
The elven scout new to the route introduced himself to Tobin when they were
packed and ready to head out.  Of course, their packs were light and the
preparation did not take long--Jovin expected the party to be gone only
three days total, and these elves knew how to live off the land.  The scout's
name was Karnil and he seemed eager and youthful.  He admitted he had
joined the ranks of the scouts only recently, after giving up on the life of
a farmer.  He wanted to see the rest of the world.  Or at least, a bigger part
of it than his family's farm.</p>
<p>
"Jovin told me about who it is you're looking for.  I hope you find him!"  His
speech was as eager as his demeanor, and Tobin appreciated it.
</p>
<p>
"Thanks, I hope we find him, too."  Tobin never really thought about it from
that perspective before--that there was only a possibility that she would
not find Fifty-First.  She had always assumed that she would find him.
</p>
<p>
By the end of the day, after following barely visible paths and at times
sneaking through dense thickets of trees and bushes, the party was
tired.  En route, the party of 8 spread out--after all, why send more than
one on a scouting trip, albeit a routine one, if all the members stuck
together?  For the most party, Tobin remained close enough to where
she could still see Jovin--she wasn't about to get lost if she could help
it.  "Not that I couldn't find my way back," she reassured herself silently.
Her confidence in her own natural talents as a native of wooded
areas kept her in good spirits whenever the group would separate,
sometimes for more than half an hour at a time.
</p>
<p>
Thankfully, the journey was uneventful the first day.  They had passed
through no less than three areas of thick woods, separated by grass-filled
plains.  Occasionally Jovin or one of the others would point out a broken
branch or a marked tree: signs of passersby--or previous scouting parties.
As dusk swooped over the land, Jovin gathered the scouts together for
a brief talk.  They were at the western edge of a thicket of trees that
overlooked a grassy valley.
</p>
<p>
"Alright, then.  Anyone pick up anything in the last separation?" Jovin
asked of his group.  They all shook their heads.  "Good.  Scouts
sometimes get a boring day, but that'll all change tonight.  I expect
Onearm's scouts to find us any time now--it's a game we sometimes
play.  Who will find who first?  Let's see if we can't get them this time."
</p>
<p>
"We'll get 'em tonight, Jovin."  It was Dkalin that spoke.  He tried to sound
jocular, but Tobin detected a hint of something else, something more
serious that fun and games.
</p>
<p>"Right!" Jovin spoke confidently.  "Remember to signal as soon as you spot
them."  The scouts dispersed, except for Karnil and Jovin.  Tobin naturally
stayed with them.  "Since this is both of your first times approaching the
Onearm prowling grounds, I thought it best if you two stick with me."  Tobin
thought maybe Jovin was hoping to show off a bit.  He seemed genuinely
confident, and Tobin felt genuinely at ease in his presence.  Karnil was eager
as before, and his eyes were wide as they searched the valley below.
"We'll let the others do the wandering; we'll just stay put and keep our eyes
peeled.  It'll give us a chance to talk, too."
</p>
<p>
Jovin continued.  "This valley is sort of the generally accepted edge
of the land that Onearm and his troupes call home.  There's a few towns
nestled among his territory--halfling dwellings, mostly, with the most
famous one a place called Sage.  He turned to Tobin.  "If we don't soon find
your fellow priest, I think your best bet is to go to that place next.  More
than likely, if he was supposed to meet up with Onearm, it would have
been there."
</p>
<p>
Tobin, Karnil and Jovin scanned the valley for any movement.  To her
credit, Tobin picked out a couple of the Ashan elves as they moved
slowly and secretively amid the tall grass and shrubbery of the valley.
But, no sign of halflings.  After a minute's silence, Jovin queried
of Karil and Tobin what they thought of their first scouting mission.

<span class="dm">Well, what say ye, Tobin?</span></p>
