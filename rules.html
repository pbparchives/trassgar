AD&amp;D Second Edition Rules sample</h3>

<hr>
Let's face it.  Not everyone has the AD&amp;D manuals needed for
rules lookups.  If you want to buy the manuals, check out
<a href="http://bsc.edu/~bassaf/gnarlyboooks.html" target="_top">The
Gnarly Booksellers</a> where you can find some listed.
But for now, I thought I'd post a sampling of the AD&amp;D Second Edition
rules for help in writing your moves.

<font color="yellow">Determining Initiative</font>
<br>
To determine initiative for a combat round,
roll d10 per side in the conflict.  Lowest roll wins initiative.
If more than one side rolls the same initiative roll, action
for those sides happens simultaneously.

<p>
<a name="tohit">
<font color="yellow">To hit or not to hit</font>
<br>
To determine if you
successfully attack someone in combat, subtract your opponent's
armor class (AC) from your THAC0.  This is the number you have
to get or beat on a roll of a d20.
