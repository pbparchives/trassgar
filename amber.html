The trek to Forest's Edge was uneventful.  They (Gnash, Amber, Slahm and Gargamel) avoided the main roads, sticking to thickly
wooded elven trails where they were less likely to run into an ambush or a pack of patrolling orcs.  Of course, the trails were a
little worse for wear after the barbarian tunneled through.  A fungal snake was the most excitement—that and watching
Gargamel steal, replace, and then resteal Slahm's moneybag.  But even so, they came over the hill to see
Forest's Edge below them before they could get bored.
<p>
"Ah, Jack's ale and racknah tenderloin with potatoes, here I come!" Gnash bellowed, starting down the hill.<p>
"That does sound tasty," Amber added, following.<p>
"Me want big beefy leg!" Slahm grunted, since he wasn't quite sure what a tenderloin was.<p>
"I, for one, am looking forward to that comfy feather bed.  Slick and the girls better have looked out for our stuff while we
were away.  If my favorite pillow has been damaged…" Gargamel said, sleepily.<p>
And with that, they headed into town.<p>
Everything looked normal enough; there were a few bar-goers lining the road who had not had the presence of mind
to find their way home.  The bars were quiet, since the lunch hour had not yet begun, and when the bars were quiet there
wasn't much else to make noise in this town.  Since the hush of morning had not yet lifted, the foursome entered Klive's
establishment for a short reunion and a nice nap.
<p> <p>
*****<p>
Feeling refreshed, Gargamel and Slahm were exchanging stories with Slick, Klive, and the girls when Amber emerged from the
stairwell.  "Good afternoon," she said, making her way to the table.  "Gnash up yet?"<p>
"Nope." Klive answered.<p>
"Good!" she said excitedly, and bounded back up the stairs.  It seemed like only a moment when they heard the roar of
a startled, angry dwarf, and Amber ran past them and hid in the coat closet, giggling.  They heard footsteps approaching from
the stairwell, and looked up to see Gnash, fully awake, wearing his helmet and gear.  Then, they saw raw eggs dripping
down his face from under his helmet.  Stifling a laugh, Gargamel said, "Uhm, Gnash, what happened?"<p>
"Where is she?" he gruffed, the anger giving way to embarrassment.<p>
"Where is who?" Klive asked, trying to look innocent.<p>
"It's not wise to play games with an angry, wet dwarf" Gargamel warned under his breath.<p>
"I'm only going to ask one more time--WHERE IS SHE??" Gnash yelled.  Beer-sheba couldn't hold it back any longer,
and burst into uncontrollable giggles.  Once she started, Klive, Gargamel and the others followed, and soon were all
rolling in their chairs with laughter.  Gnash grumbled under his breath, and it was only when he turned to go up the stairs
that they realized he had a handful of eggs himself, ready to aim at his target.  Before he could get up the second stair,
Amber burst out of the closet, stumbling on a rather large box, and barreled out the door.  Gnash, using his boots to their fullest,
turned and flew after her, determined, bits of egg dripping with each step.  The last thing they heard was Amber's tinking
laughter and Gnash yelling, "I'm gonna get you good for this, Amber!"<p>
*****<p>
Jack looked up from the bar to see Gnash and Amber strolling in, laughing and covered from head to toe with egg.  "Let me
guess," Jack started, "you tried to catch your breakfast and it was smarter than you?"<p>
"Very funny, Jack," Amber replied.<p>
"Two ales, and two HUGE servings of your racknah tenderloin with potatoes.  And don't skimp on the gravy!" Gnash
ordered.
<p>
"And Jack, hold the egg!" Amber added.  With that and a good laugh, they started on their
first glass of ale.
<p>
Several glasses later, and after cleaning up a bit, Amber, Gnash and Jack had caught up on
the news and become quite inebriated.  <font color="green">[At this point, Amber and Gnash
are suffering a -3 to Int, -4 to Wis, -2 to Dex, +1 Cha, and +1 hit points due to being
moderately intoxicated.]</font>  "I think you two better get on back and get some sleep,"
Jack suggested, slyly substituting water for their last few glasses.  They didn't notice.
After seven mugs of mead and three glasses of ale, nothing had any taste anymore.
<p>
"You know, I am a little tired," Amber slurred.
<p>
"Alright, well then we're off!" Gnash added, and they headed out the door.  Little did they know
that they wouldn't get back to the High Safe to bed until much, much later.  They stumbled
out the door, and Gnash looked up, seriously.  "Something's not quite right," he mumbled.
<p>
"I'll say!"  Amber added, as she surveyed their position.  On one side was a group of large
well-armed thugs.  On the other was a halfling, dusty and a little dismayed.

<font color="green">[Initiative rolls: Bad guys: 6, Amber: 2,
Gnash: 4, Tilder: 3.  Amber strikes first!]</font>  Amber
smiled a smile of mixed emotions.
<em>"My sword hasn't seen any
human blood in a long, long time,"</em>
she pondered.  The thought of
slicing a human's head right off its body appealed to her in the
right set of circumstances.  However, she couldn't know the
affiliation of these men. All she could be sure of was that they
were bullies, and possibly murderers.  But then, so was she, in
the right set of circumstances.  <em>"So what to do?"</em>
<p>
"Uh, Krynn to Amber!  Krynn to Amber!  Anyone home?" Gnash
grunted from clenched teeth.  His hands were still doing
considerable harm to Leeden, but two of the other thugs
were closing in fast, while the other watched Amber and Tilder
closely.
<p>
"Oh.  Sorry Gnash.  I was having an ethical debate in my mind.
To chop off their heads or NOT to chop off their heads, that
was the question.  I'll try to stay focused."
<p>
"And, did you happen to come to any conclusions in your little
moral dilemma?" Gnash growled, a little impatient, as thug
number one was reaching for his sword, and within a blade's
distance from Gnash's neck.
<p>
"Yes, actually!" Amber replied loudly.  "I decided that if they
so much as flinch another milliscarp in your direction I
will have no qualms whatsoever in spilling their smelly runny
blood all over the street.  Do you think they realize that?"
<p>
Out of the corner of her eye she kept watch over the halfling.
He seemed harmless enough, but they didn't know him, and no
man's honor was evident at first glance.
<p>
<font color="green"><strong>As Amber made her decision public
knowledge, Gnash pondered his, and emitted a smelly grunt of dwarven beer-breath in Leeden's face, accompanied by a wide
toothy-grinned snarl.  </strong>[I realize this is a
painfully drawn-out method of resolving this
"combat" situation, but Tilder is up next!]</font>

"Gnash, I don't know what this little fellow's story is, but we need to get back to Klive's and
get some rest.  My head is spinning.  But at the same time, I have the feeling that I need to know
why Tilder seems to be deathly afraid of me." Amber said thoughtfully.<p>
"Agreed.  Why don't we haul his butt back to Highsafe and have one of us keep watch over him
until he wakes.  Then, perhaps we can get some answers,"  Gnash said aloud, <em>"and maybe some
food,"</em> he thought in unison with his grumbling stomach.<p>
"Alright.  Want me to carry anything for you?" Amber offered, clearly implying she wanted Gnash
to tote the halfling to the Inn.  Seeing some resistance in the
dwarf's eyes, she added, "I mean, I wouldn't want you to have a load that you <em>couldn't
handle</em> or anything..."<p>
"Couldn't handle?  COULDN'T HANDLE???" with an offended snort, he began lifting the halfling,
along with the rest of his gear.  "I am a dwarf, Gnashuphagnewtognius Gnarly, and I can do
anything I dern blasted well want to do, and I can't believe...."  Snorting and grunting, with a
few dwarven unintelligibles 
thrown in for flavor, Gnash began making his way down the street, continuing to mumble
incomprehensibles, with Amber strolling behind, looking very proud of herself.
<p>
<center>__________</center>
<p>
When they arrived at the Inn, Klive had closed the bar for the day, so they had to enter in Inn
instead of going through the tavern.<p>  
"Well, I wonder how inconspicous this is," Amber sarcastically remarked, "I'm sure it's
everyday that
a brawny dwarf and a high-elf saunter through the front doors of a local inn carrying an
unconscious halfing.  I'm sure we haven't attracted anyone's attention."<p>
"Well, for all they know we're a bunch of unlikely drinking buddies making sure that we all
get to bed safely.  Don't worry so blasted much." Gnash grumbled, panting a bit from the effects
of the alcohol and carrying the weight of the halfling across town.
<p>
"Maybe you're right.  But I don't like it.  WHen will our secret entrance be completed?"
<p>
"I don't know, I haven't asked for a raggin fraggin status report lately!" Gnash barked.
<p>
"Fine, Gnarly!  Don't get testy with me!  You're the one who wanted to carry the halfling
across town to show how strong and male you are!" Amber bit back.
<p>
"Grrrrrllll!"  Gnash growled.
<p>
"Clearly it's past your bedtimes!" Klive added cheerily as they approached the desk.  You know
the way up!" and then he turned his thoughts back to the local newssheet sitting on his desk.
He could hear them grouching and grumbling at one another all the way up the stairs.
<p>
<center>__________</center>
<p>
Gnash laid Tilder on a bed in Olen and Stor's room, while Amber woke Beer-sheba to watch him.
As soon as Beer-sheba and Amber returned, Gnash flew out of the room and into his own.
<p>
"Let us know the moments he wakes," Amber instructed, "we need to speak with him.  But, let him
know that he is not a prisoner; rather, he is our guest."
<p>
"Sure," Beer-sheeba replied.  "You know I'm the resident night-owl.  Will he give me any
trouble?"
<p>
"Well, he's a thief and a halfling, so probably.  Just don't let him fool you or rob
you.  He owes us a debt of gratitude; we're hoping he'll see fit to give us some answers
to settle that debt."  Amber replied.  With a yawn, she added, "Good night.  I hope he
doesn't wake until I can get some quality sleep in!"  And with that, she left Tilder
under Beer-sheba's careful watch.
