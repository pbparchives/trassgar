Xanter looked at Jolan and responded, "I don't mind answering a few 
questions.</span>
If I can answer them I will.  Sorry, but I can't help you with 
the black nymphs."
</p><p>
"Tilder, Amber," he said, noticing the she-elf walking away, "if you head
northeast up
the Furter River to find Onearm's clan, I would like to tag along--if you 
decide to go that is.  I might yet provide some valuable assistance."
</p><p>
Xanter wracked his brain for more information which might be useful to all 
involved.  He began to feel anguish at the grizzly sight of his dead 
companions.
</p><p>
"If it is all the same to you, Amber, I shall stay in Two Rivers' 
Forge, then," Tilder said to Amber's back.
</p><p>
[[And now, we move to the super-slo-mo halfling thought-cam!]]
</p><p>
He didn't know if the she-elf had heard, but he didn't care. He had had 
quite enough of decapitations, and knew that he would only see more if 
he joined the ghoul lynch mob. Besides, what use was he in a fight, 
other than to bowl people over and get all bruised? And he surely didn't 
want to be recognized, however remote the possibility, by any of Syona's 
band that he'd robbed as part of Ounze!.
</p><p>
On the other hand, the townies here sure treated him wierd, and 
the mortician didn't even thank him for saving his life. (And now he 
had no more healing potions!)  Moreover, nobody seemed to notice that 
Syona Onearm was in Xanter's group when they were ambushed. The fact that 
Onearm might now be a pile of ashes on The End's floor stones had 
apparently escaped them, and if that were true, Onearm's band might have 
already dissolved.
</p><p>
[[End of thought-cam]]
</p><p>
Tilder looked over at Xanter, the mysterious zombie-halfling, wondering 
what he would do, and if the townies were going to treat him any 
differently.
</p><p>
"What do we do now Tilder?" Xanter asked.  Pausing a moment, he
added, "Did I do something to make Amber mad?
</p><p>
<!-- 355 -->
Tilder responded, "No Xanter, I do not think it is you. Amber seems a little
out of her element right now. Don't worry, my friend!" Tilder gave Xanter
a wink and a look that said succinctly, "Elves!"
</p><p>
<!-- 356 -->
For the first time in a long while Xanter laughed out loud. Just for a moment
his painful thoughts were forgotten and he act like a real halfling.
</p><p>
***
</p><p>
<!-- 354 -->
The outside air felt good on her face. Amber emerged from the morgue 
and headed toward a small grove of trees along the water's edge. She 
didn't even feel the moisture from the moss on the rock as she sat down 
heavily. What was wrong with her? Normally she would have held herself in 
check with Tilder, and not been quite so... well, to the point. 
Something wasn't right here, and she felt it all the way down to her bones, 
and it was rattling her usual detached calm. Maybe it was being alone 
again. The last time she had been alone... well, it hadn't been under the 
most pleasant of circumstances. Of course, that was when she met Gnash 
Gnarly, and all of a sudden drinking her troubles away in a bar had 
become a grand adventure. "There I go again, rambling around in my head," 
she thought with a sigh. She wished that Gnash was here. Heck, Olen 
would do in this pinch. She needed perspective, and honesty, and this 
halfling thief wasn't familiar enough to her yet for him to be a candidate.
</p><p>
"Gnash will be here at any time," she reminded herself, "and then you 
can get some insight. Until then, get with it and summon that courier!" 
For a few moments, she thought about her parents, her siblings, and her 
special place in the castle. Then, after murmuring a prayer of 
relaxation, she rose, calmer, to send a messenger and to talk with those that 
were going about their excursion.
</p><p>
As she approached the group, she motioned to "Mort". "Hey there!" she 
called pleasantly, "can I trouble you to find a messenger for me?" 
</p><p>
<span class="trf">"Sure, ma'am!"</span>
was his hearty reply. <span class="trf">"Long distance or short?"</span>
</p><p>
"Long. Please alert the royal courier's station in town that the chief 
courier is needed here at the morgue," she replied, wondering how many 
questions the people of the town were going to ask about this one. She 
hated to be the center of attention, as always happened when her royal 
heritage was known. "Well, maybe they'll just spread lots of juicy 
rumors and leave me alone," she though to herself with a smile.
</p><p>
<span class="trf">"Sure thing, ma'am," the mortician replied,
and moved to speak with a young looking townie.</span>
</p><p>
***
</p><p>
<!-- 357 -->
After Xanter's laughter abated, he suddenly coughed
uncontrollably, and doubled over, gripping his middle. "Augh! What's happening
to me!" Tilder and Jolan rushed to his side, and the mortician whom Jolan
had cured sprung to action. "Here, bring him in here!" They did, and the
human urged them to sit Xanter down on a chair with a reclined back. Xanter
came out of his coughing fit and breathed slowly, and Jolan bent at his 
knees to see the halfling eye-to-eye.
</p><p>
While Jolan ministered to Xanter, the moritician pulled Tilder back
toward the door and spoke in hushed tones.
<span class="trf">"Tilder, I didn't have a 
chance to thank you earlier. I think you saved my life!"</span> He touched his 
throat, as if still amazed that it was not still torn and bleeding.
<span class="trf">"I'm Sarl, and I'll repay you, I promise!"</span>
</p><p>
Tilder felt a little better at the human's thanks, and wondered
how Sarl would repay him. He stared out the doorway to the field outside,
and watched Amber as she talked with Mort about something. He considered
her words to him and reflected on her position in life, and how it must
direct her actions.
</p><p>
***
</p><p>
<span class="trf">"Xanter, take a deep breath!"</span> Jolan pulled out a
spherical vial
and uncorked it.  <span class="trf">"I've never treated a patient such as you,
my friend, but
I believe this will still work!"</span> Jolan spread some of the ointment onto
Xanter's abdomen, which had started bleeding again. Jolan noted that the
blood looked almost fresh, not a decayed, stale, or clotted as he would
expect from an undead being. Xanter noticed this as well. Although he
wasn't an expert on blood types, his confusion grew deeper.
</p><p>
<span class="dm">
[[Rule Intrustion: Jolan applied some Keoghtome's (spelling? Ack!) ointment to
Xanter's wound. I think I rolled Xanter's hit points (10) wrong. He should have
more than 10 for being level 2/2. Your new total hit points is 12, Xanter.  The
ointment healed (up to) 1d4+8=12 points, back to maximum.]]</span>
</p><p>
Jolan looked at Xanter with squinted eyes.  <span class="trf">"What has
happened to you, Xanter?"</span>
Xanter related again what he could remember, from the surprise attack
at the campsite, to his blacking out--death, he corrected himself grimly.
He didn't remember much more than before, but he again related the look
that the elven priest had given to him.  <span class="trf">"If I had to guess,
I'd say something is preventing you from re-animating fully as a undead
ghoulish halfling, while
at the same time is keeping your mental faculties in order. As if you had
been resurrected, not re-animated through the evil magic of the undead who
killed you. Hm, you've got me stumped! I shall watch your career with great
interest."</span> Jolan grinned.  <span class="trf">"Has anyone ever told you
about the black nymphs?"</span>
</p><p>
<!-- 359 one paragraph only -->
"Thanks Jolan," Xanter said, patting Jolan on the shoulder. "I 
hope to be around for a long time to come career wise!"  He shook his head "no"
and grinned at the black nymphs comment.
</p><p>

</p><p>
Mort sent the young man on his way to the courier's station,
and went back inside The End to clean up the mess. Amber felt confident
that Titus would make good time and stay out of trouble on his east to
Furterville, especially if traveled straight there and didn't follow
the river's curvy path. There was enough travel between the two towns
that there was even a path and a few markers along the way. She wondered,
though, if he would run into some of the same trouble that Syona's clan
had run into, or if that danger was further north upstream. She'd met Titus
before once at Futerville and knew him to be a courageous and intelligent
man. She left her thoughts, glanced through the doors to see Tilder
looking at her, and wondered if they really did need a break from each other.
Her constant wonderings about the secrets he knew, and her not-so-subtle
attempts at finding them out seemed to be more stressful of late.
</p><p>
<span class="dm">
[[DM: Ok, who's gonna do what? Jolan will join a scouting party east, 
whoever goes (whether it is all or some or none of you (Xanter, Amber, 
Tilder).]]</span>
</p><p>
***
</p><p>
<!-- 360 -->
Amber thought more about the stress she was feeling, and how it must 
affect the Tilder. They certainly didn't know one another very well, and 
his hesitance to come forward with the location of the rangers made him 
seem inherently untrustworthy.
<span class="dm">[WIS check: rolls 9, her intuition kicks in]</span>
But the more she thought about it, she realized that it seemed 
that the stress in their relationship seemed to grow whenever she took 
on more of her traditional role. Recalling their first meeting, he did 
seem to recognize her... why did her position make him uncomfortable? 
Why did being with a royal make him uncomfortable? What was he hiding?
</p><p>
"Oh well," she thought, "we'll have enough time to drag it out of him 
later." But she knew in her heart that she would only allow him more 
time as a courtesy, and if things began looking any more dire for the 
kingdom she would have to force his hand. She didn't relish the thought.
</p><p>
With a gloomy look on her face, she turned, focused herself on the task 
at hand, and approached the group standing near the entrance of the 
morgue, who had been joined by Xanter and Tilder.
</p><p>
"So, who's leading this little undead-finding campaign? I can give 
whoever two days of my time; anyone else going?"
</p><p>
<!-- 361 -->
"I don't think anyone would accept me as leader in my 
present condition, not that I ever had such leadership skills, but if Tilder 
is joining count me in Amber!" Xanter offered happily.
</p><p>
<!-- 370 -->
</p><p>
Having already made up his mind, Tilder shook his head, albeit 
hesitantly after Xanter's implied entreaty. "I have seen enough bloodshed for 
now," he offered tersely, then added, "I can think of better ways to 
pass the time before Gnash arrives than ghoul lynching."
</p><p>
Xanter bowed his head and looked forlornly at his purple-streaked 
hands. He opened his mouth to submit his resignation when Tilder 
interrupted.
</p><p>
"Uhhh, that is to say, I will accompany such a 'hunting party' only in 
the capacity of observer, and with sole charge to solve Xanter's 
puzzle, no more, no less," Tilder said, all the while observing the 
despondent zombie-halfling.
</p><p>
"Ah, what am I getting myself into?" Tilder thought. He'd always been a 
one-track Halfling, never having to dilute his attentions from food 
"procurement." But then he'd joined THoR, and the elves' faith in him had 
helped him realize he was capable of much more. Ouch! He hadn't meant 
to go there. Well, three quests were thrice as likely to keep those 
demons at bay. He flickered a smile at his friends, and hoped Finty favored 
the foolhardy.
</p><p>
<!-- 363-4 -->
<span class="trf">"Jolan gets nod on this one,"</span> the peace officer decided
after a moment's thought. <span class="trf">"If it's a bunch of undead nasties
you're to be up against, he's the best man in town for that job."</span>
</p><p>
Jolan spoke up.
<span class="trf">"Of course I need some stealth and brawn to back me up. As 
you know, my power is finite."</span> All who witnessed the recent battle 
recalled Jolan's turning of some, but not all of the halfling ghouls.
</p><p>
* * *
</p><p>
In the hues of the late afternoon all the dead and undead had been 
buried in a cemetary across the river. Xanter identified as many of his 
former comrades as he could from facial features, and through the others, 
by their left-behind equipment. He did manage to confirm that Syona was 
not among the dead. Bell returned from his wood shop with grave markers 
to identify each halfling. Xanter collected the twenty head bands of 
his friends, washed them in the river, and put them in his pack.
</p><p>
Jolan said a few words in a ceremony at the gathering place upstairs 
from The End, and asked for a blessing for their mission to find--or 
deliver--justice.
</p><p>
"And answers," Xanter thought to himself. He noticed that 
the purple stains of his skin had lessened somewhat in color, and his 
coughing had mostly subsided.
</p><p>
* * *
</p><p>
After the burials and ceremony, and before they 
assembled for their trek east, Amber met with the courier Mort had sent 
for. She also left instructions with the Constable and town's watch to 
be on the lookout for a burly dwarf named Gnash.
</p><p>
<span class="trf">"Right, Nash. He'll get a warm welcome, of course."</span>
</p><p>
"Actually, it's Gnash," Amber pointed out, correcting the 
Constable's handwriting.
</p><p>
The Constable looked stunned. <span class="trf">"Gnash? Uh, as in Gnash 
Gnarly?"</span> Amber smiled, winked, and left the Constable to wonder in 
amazement at the visitor whose tales--some much taller than others--preceeded 
him.
</p><p>
<span class="dm">
[[GM: Amber, what do you say to the courier? He will travel a different 
route east than you all. His route will be straight east, while you all 
decide to follow the river to the site of the Onearm camp and battle.]]
</span>
</p><p>
* * *
</p><p>
The group gathered for the mission that late afternoon was indeed led 
by Jolan Tru the Ikran priest. With water and food supplies refreshed, 
and their horses eager for a good evening's journey, the group stood 
near the futhermost east point of the town. Amber stood near to Tilder and 
Xanter and groomed her horse while she studied the halflings. She 
realized the commonality both halflings shared despite their differences. 
Each she felt an obligation to befriend--Tilder, partially to learn his 
secrets, and Xanter, partially to uncover the mystery behind his 
half-transformation. Also going with them, surprisingly, was Bell, who seemed 
eager for a change of pace. He brought from his home some armor and 
weapons which seemed recently polished and oiled.
</p><p>
<span class="trf">"I was a warrior in my earlier days,"</span> Bell confessed,
<span class="trf">"before 
I settled into the wood working trade. Don't worry, I still know how to 
swing a blade."</span>
</p><p>
<span class="trf">"Alright, gang."</span> Jolan surveyed the group, and
thought that 
this band of stealth and strength combined with his own holy talents 
would prove a good group for the mission. <span class="trf">"We should head
out before we 
loose all our daylight. As the poet and musician once wrote, 'Saddle up 
your horses, we got a trail to blaze!'"</span>  With that, the five started off 
east, following the Furter upstream on it's north bank.
</p><p>

[[DM: (Xanter, your borrowed mount is a black pony named Onyx.) With no 
obvious choices for you all to make just now, your next posts could

Jolan will yield field decisions like marching order, when and 
where to break for camp, to the Ranger of the party (Amber) and her 
knowledge of tracking, hunting, good campsites, good marching order, etc. 
With no obvious decisions to make, your next posts might include dialog

<!-- 365 -->
<p>
Climbing onto the back of his black pony, named Onyx, Xanter thinks
to himself, "I would have hated to ride through the wilds on a pony with 
no name."</p>
<blockquote>[[OOC: Sorry DM, that was taken from a song.]]</blockquote>
<p>
Once on pony back he 
kept near Tilder, and remained very alert.  Leaning forward he whispered
to his pony. "Ya' be a good pony Onyx and I won't eat your brains."
</p><p>
"Nyeeeehhhehehheheheheheeee! Pkkhkwhkwhwhwkwkw.... 
Pkwkwhwkwhww," the horse replied.
</p><p>
Being very perceptive and looking from Tilder to Amber, Xanter felt more than 
a little tension in the air between the two. Having not been around 
them long enough to know or understand the history between them, he attempted
to ignore it for now, at least until it became a problem.
</p><p>
He watched and listened, and tried to learn as much as he could.
</p><p>
<!-- 366 -->
As the horses and gear were being packed and readied, Titus rode up on 
a dark brown stallion. 
</p><p>
<span class="trf">"I was told someone had sent for me?"</span> he asked Bell,
at the other horses. 
</p><p>
Amber overheard and began to make her way over. <span class="trf">"Uh, I'm not
sure who that would've been, Titus. We don't have any officials with us,
as far as I know,"</span> Bell replied. <span class="trf">"But hey, I can ask
around for you."</span>
</p><p>
As Titus saw Amber approach, he placed his hand on Bell's arm to stay 
him. <span class="trf">"Ah, there she is!"</span> he said, and began to walk
toward her.
</p><p>
She looked different than he remembered. Her face had dirt smudged 
across it, her hair was wild and blowing in the wind, and she looked
content. It was good to see that contentment. It had been many 
moons... <span class="trf">"Your Majesty,"</span> Titus offered,
lowering himself to one knee.
</p><p>
"Titus, please, rise," she said. "I have a message to be sent to the 
Third House."
</p><p>
<span class="trf">"Very well."</span>
</p><p>
"Tell my father and mother of the undead 'army' that is roaming this 
area, and of their unfortunate targets. Tell them that I request that a
gove be sent to investigate the situation and provide recon and 
protection for the people in this area. Let them know that I am doing two
days of recon myself, and will give all information that I find to the 
captain of the gove."
</p><p>
<span class="trf">"Yes, mi'lady."</span>
</p><p>
"And Titus," she said, as she turned to go, "tell them that I love 
them, and all is well."
</p><p>
<span class="trf">"I will, mi'lady. Safe travels to you."</span>
</p><p>
"And a safe journey to you, my friend."
</p><p>
Amber tightened the bridle on her mount, and watched Titus ride off 
into the wood. With his ranger skills and his magical allies, he would
have no trouble getting to the castle and notifying her parents. 
Saddling her black mare, she looked to Jolan to see if the band was travel
ready.
</p><p>
<!-- 368 -->
Seated on his pony, Xanter looked toward Tilder, who for 
some reason seemed to be taking his time getting ready. "You coming 
Tilder?"
</p><p>
<!-- 369 -->
"Yes," Tilder agreed reluctantly. His last-minute plan to stall for 
Gnash's return had proved fruitless. "May Finty favor the foolhardy," he 
muttered.
</p><p>
"What was that, Tilder?" Xanter asked.
</p><p>
"Oh, nothing. Just stay close, Xanter, and remind me occasionally why 
I'm doing this."
</p><p>
<!-- 370 -->
"Okay!" Xanter offered cheerily.
"We are doing this to save other people from meeting 
the fate of those in the morgue."  Noticing Tilder's glare, he grinned.
"Maybe I should have waited a bit longer before reminding him," he
thought to himself.
</p><p>

</p><p>
With Titus on his way to Furterville, nerves steeled for the journey
ahead, and saddlebags packed tightly, the five mounted their horses
and rode east. They remained within eyesight of the river as they
followed it upstream on its north bank. At first they rode in a good gallop,
wanting to get as far as they could before it got dark. By nightfall, they
slowed to a walk; even though Amber and the halflings could see partially
in the dark, neither the horses nor the humans from Two Rivers' Forge had
that special ability. When the light was almost gone from the sky, they
stopped to let their horses drink from the river and get a rest themselves.
It was only then that the group realized they had traveled mostly in silence.
Bell and Jolan had exchanged a few words, but apparently they had not talked
much in the past as they limited themselves to mostly pleasantries.
</p><p>
Having dismounted and opened his pack, Jolan retrieved a torch to
light it. <span class="trf">"Well folks, the horses will be good to keep
going for a little while longer tonight I think."</span> He looked at the rest
of his traveling companions. <span class="trf">"I'm not so sure we should ride
them into the night, although they probably could if we pushed them to."</span>
He looked to Amber and Xanter for
their reactions, while Tilder remained consciously in the shadows of the night.
</p><p>
<span class="trf">"So, Xanter,"</span> Bell began a bit nervously.
<span class="trf">"Do you recognize this area at all? How close are we to,
well, the...."</span>
</p><p>
"The place where I died?" Xanter offered helpfully, trying to
talk objectively about his own death.
</p><p>
<span class="dm">
[[DM: The DM now takes a few liberties with Xanter's character. As a member
of the semi-nomadic Syona Onearm clan of halflings, we assume Xanter knows
the area quite well between Furterville east through to Ash, and from the
Lanaag river north to the lake (Stomerd Lake), as that is the area the
clan regularly travels and scouts. Xanter's knowledge of the land
west of Furterville is not as good.]]</span>
</p><p>
<span class="trf">"Well, yes."</span> Bell shifted uncomfortably but held his
attention.  Amber and Tilder both took interest in what Xanter had to say.
</p><p>
"At this pace, we could reach Furterville by tomorrow evening
I think. We had met up with Fifty-First at Furterville, and together we
had traveled west to visit some of the outlying settlements." He opened and
closed his eyes. "That is where we made camp that night."
</p><p>
<span class="trf">"Then we should be on the lookout for trouble tonight,"</span>
Jolan spoke, <span class="trf">"in the
case that our adversaries, or adversary, has journeyed west from where
Xanter last remembers."</span>
</p><p>
<span class="dm">
[[DM]] What do you do? Break for camp? Keep going? If you break for
camp, what is your watch schedule? Trassgar's day is roughly equivalent
to Earth's (~24 hours, at this point I can't remember if we said it was more
or less, but we did say at one point...) day.</span>
</p><p>
<!-- 373 -->
Xanter offered his opinion to Jolan about their course of action.
"I would not advise night riding Jolan, but I imagine it 
would be Amber's choice as do we continue or not.  It matters not to me." He 
turned to Tilder. "You seem awfully ghoulishly quite. Is there a reason Tilder?"
</p><p>
<!-- 375 -->
Tilder looked at his halfling zombie companion, whose face seemed 
to move of its own accord in the dancing torchlight. He then peered down 
at his own hand, which was scrunching up his belt pouch without 
abandon. "Ah, Finty, gimme a break tonight, eh?" he whispered softly to the 
capricious goddess.
</p><p>
He did not know what it was about the darkness that sometimes gave him 
the creeps. Perhaps it was because during the previous night, the kech 
had attacked them, and the night before that, it had been Leeden and 
his thugs, and then, many more nights ago, THoR had.... His thoughts 
quickly shifted in self defense.
</p><p>
Tilder managed a smile for Xanter. "Finty rolls terribly at night, at 
least for me! Just wondering why I'm out here shivering when I could be 
sleeping in a real bed, warmly tucked under the blankets at some cozy 
inn back at Two Rivers'." Tilder tried to make it sound like he knew 
what he was talking about, but the fact remained that he'd never enjoyed a 
steady habitation; nope, no halfling-hole for this Hairfoot. That fact 
did not escape the ever-observant Xanter.
</p><p>
<!-- 379 -->
Xanter looked blankly toward Tilder. "I never believed in any of 
those gods, not that they ever did me any real favors. Be lucky you are 
living and not like me, caught capriciously somewhere in between."
</p><p>
<!-- 374 -->
"I do not think it would be wise to continue in the dark," Amber offered,
"due to the nature of our search. I suggest we find a spot that lends itself to 
an easy defense perimeter."
</p><p>
<!-- back to 375 -->
Tilder added his two bits, yawning, "For what it's worth, I agree with 
her. The ghouls rule the night! They will probably find us, not the 
other way around, and I should like to have some sleep in me before they 
come a-knocking!"  Tilder thought he'd rest a whole lot better if the 
burly dwarf named Gnash were there. Well, he'd try his best, at any rate.
</p><p>
<!-- 378 -->
With the group decision to break for the night,
Amber indicated to Jolan that she was going to go ahead just a bit and 
scout a good place to camp. He nodded, then looked back to motion to 
the others to slow their pace, and when he turned around, she was gone.
</p><p>
* * *
</p><p>
The dark seemed comforting to Amber. Maybe it was because she could see 
so well, or maybe it was because in the dark everyone looked the same. 
Her reverie was broken as she noticed an overhanging of rocks with some 
fallen boulders scattered about. At the edge of the boulders was the 
beginning of the forest. She pictured nightwatchmen on the boulders, with 
a birdseye view, and the rest of them sleeping under the overhanging, 
with only a cliff to their backs. "It's a good campsite," she thought to 
herself, then turned her mount around to join the others.
</p><p>
* * *
</p><p>
<!-- 393 -->
Amber led the way to the campsite she had found.
As they unpacked, started a fire, and sketched out a defense perimeter, 
Amber looked up to the stars from her perch high atop a boulder. She 
would be taking the first watch, so she might as well get comfortable and 
relax a bit before people went to sleep. 
</p>
<p>
As she sat, admiring the artwork of God, she noticed a brilliant star, 
falling from the sky with a sparkling trail behind it. </p>
<p>
"Ahh, a new little one of great importance has been born this night," 
she thought to herself, and smiled.

The travelers all dismounted and followed Amber's lead in setting up camp.
Xanter retrieved a brush from his tack and groomed Onyx.  It seemed to
calm him, and Xanter was glad the pony was at ease around him.
</p><p>
<span class="trf">"Here's where it gets interesting.  Right folks?"</span>
Jolan stated with a smile.
Bell looked at him nervously, and Tilder glanced up from unshouldering his
pack, confused.
</p><p>
Bell explained, picking up on Jolan's sentiment.  <span class="trf">"You know
the drill, right?  We set up camp, some of us get some sleep, and in the
middle of the night, the monsters come a callin'?"</span>
</p><p>
<span class="trf">"Right!"</span> Jolan pointed at Bell, and flourished his
hands in a sweeping gesture of the camp.  <span class="trf">"Not to worry,
though, nothing will get us on <em>my</em> watch."</span>
</p><p>
"Speaking of which," Amber said, "I'll take first watch."
</p><p>
"Me, too."  Xanter explained as Amber opened her mouth to protest.  "I don't
feel tired.  In fact, I'm not sure I could sleep, now anyway."  Xanter
leaned up against a tree and tried to get comfortable.  He wondered if he
would ever dream again, if he could never sleep again.
</p><p>
Jolan scratched his chin as he tethered his mount to a tree limb and pulled
the strap tight.  <span class="trf">"Hm, he may be right."</span>
He held us hands out and shrugged.
<span class="trf">"None of my undead friends sleep much."</span>  Jolan
laughed.  <span class="trf">"Of course, you're my only undead friend,
but you make a valid point.  The undead don't sleep.  But you're a special
case, now, aren't you?"</span>
</p><p>
Xanter suddenly felt nervous being in the spot light.
</p><p>
<span class="dm">
[[DM: Watch is set, Amber first, with Xanter looking on as he offers.
Jolan offers to take second watch. Bell and Tilder decide who stays
up third and last. Assuming ~8 hours of dark, there are easily 4 2-hour watches.
Any conversation during the night, go ahead and post it.  Assuming Xanter
does want to stay up all night, you each get a chance to talk with him
one on one.]]</span>
</p><p>
<!-- 396/Xanter -->
Xanter shrugged slightly at Jolan's laughter, "At least I haven't 
went crazy and eaten any of my friends brains while they sleep... yet!" 
He smirked somewhat. "I don't feel special. You'd think I had a new baby 
or something the way everyone has been tiptoeing around me! Go get some 
sleep Jolan, its going to be a long night."
</p><p>
Xanter leaned up against the tree, ready to stand there 
the rest of the night.  He turned his to watch Onyx occasionally.
</p><p>
<!-- 397/Tilder -->
"All I have to say is that this time, I will not fetch any 
sticks for the fire by myself!" Tilder spoke, determined.
</p><p>
Turning to Bell, Tilder remarked, "I'll take last shift, if you don't 
mind, Bell." He didn't tell Bell that his worst dreams occurred during 
the early hours of the morning, when he was most deeply asleep. A little 
preemptive move on the cursed (so he presumed) halfling's part!
</p><p>
<!--398/Amber-->
Amber brushed her horse down as she tethered her near some feed and a 
bucket of water. Her brief respite atop the boulder had been nice; but 
she had better stretch her legs before the first watch actually began. 
Xanter had already settled himself against a tree; she wondered if he 
would be eating with the rest. The racknah was turning on the spit above 
the now roaring fire, and she had to admit, it smelled good. Jolan had 
thrown some beans in a pot underneath to simmer, and the smells were 
making Amber downright ravenous.
</p><p>
Finishing up with her mare, she moved to join the others at the fire 
and eat some dinner before first watch began.
</p>

<h3 align="center">

10/3/2000 - ?/?/?
</h3>

<!-- 399/10.3/DM -->
<p>
<span class="orange">Dinner was served and eaten.</span>
Xanter realized he wasn't hungry; in fact,
he wasn't sure he would ever eat again.  He decided not to try it out.  The
halfling, caught half-way between death and undeath, stared at his hands
as the others ate with few words for conversation.  Amber said something to
Tilder but Xanter thought it only a pleasantry.  Jolan and Bell seemed
almost refreshed at their makeshift camping trip.  "Was life so boring at
Two Rivers' Forge that this quest is a welcome change of pace for them?"
he thought to himself.  He recalled the past few days and marveled at the
change of pace in his own life.  He hoped they would find answers, and
selfishly, hoped they would find a way to help him somehow.
</p>
<p>
Jolan and Bell unrolled their blankets from their horses' packs and positioned
them around the fire.  Tilder took out a blanket from his own pack
and cuddled up in it.  Xanter saw determination in the other halfling's
eyes as they reflected the firelight of their camp.  Soon, the humans were
asleep. Sleep came to Tilder more slowly.  Before he knew it, he and Amber
were the only ones awake: first watch had begun.
</p><p>
After an hour, Amber crouched down to grab a stick and poke it into the flames.
She pulled it out when it was burnt at the tip, and stared at the fading
glow of the charred wood.  Xanter had continued his solitary pose against
a tree, and tried not to stare at Amber.  He wasn't sure what to say, and
he figured Amber was all business so he didn't think he should strike up
any pleasantries anyway.
</p><p>
Amber, for her part, watched the embers on the twig fade into a black
crisp.  "How short their lives are," she thought to herself, "in comparison
with my own."  She wondered, "where will we all be when this adventure
has faded from the present, and even from our memories?"  Amber thought of
Gnash, and how he'd probably have a comment at this point, if he were awake,
that is.  "We definitely wouldn't have any leftovers, that's for sure,"
Amber joked silently.  She looked up at Xanter and met his gaze.
</p><p>
<span class="dm">
[[DM: One hour of first watch remains.  Apart from Tilder's snoring, do
the other players have anything else to add to masterful literary rendition
of the first watch?]]
</span>
</p><p>
<!-- 400/10.4/Xanter -->
Standing in his solitary pose against a tree, Xanter wondered if his lack
pleasantries would upset anyone, mostly Amber, who cast glances in his
direction occasionaly. Blinking his eyes a few times, he continued his
unrelenting guard duty in silence.
</p><p>
<!-- 401/10.6/Amber -->
After poking the fire a few times for good measure, Amber headed to her perch
on the boulder. Xanter didn't seem to want to chat, and
she wasn't in any mood to coax. 
</p><p>
"Xanter, I'm going to go sit up on that boulder for a bit," she offered as she
moved into the shadows.
</p><p>
She had noticed that Xanter seemed to attach himself to Tilder in an almost
familial way. Wondering if he had experienced some kind of
xenophobia, she scaled the boulder and settled into a comfortable groove. "Ah,
this is better," she thought to herself, "just me, myself, and
the shadows!" And with that, she began to familiarize herself with each shadow
and nature-provided item in her area and reminisce
about a time when she wasn't the only elf around. 
</p><p>
<!-- 404/10.11/DM -->
The second hour of first watch passed uneventfully. Amber tracked a few
light-bugs as they flitted in and out of some of the foilage, and
also noticed some kind of night scavenger digging around, its eyes reflecting
the fire light and giving its presence away. Using the positions
of the moons to calculate the time, she rose from her position up top the
boulder and jumped down silently back to the camp. She caught
Xanter's attention as she emerged back into the firelight herself. He hadn't
moved from what she could tell.
</p><p>
Apart from a few whisps of his horse's tail, Xanter watched nothing else but
the rising smoke from the camp fire. Once he threw
a couple of twigs into it, but the fire was a good one and didn't need much
tending.
</p><p>
"Is it time already?" Jolan said softly as Amber approached.
She hadn't even spoken or roused him, yet he had awakened all the
same. "And I was just getting to the good part!"
</p><p>
Amber smirked and rolled her eyes at the comment, full-well knowing what
human males joked about from their sleep.
</p><p>
"What? I was dreaming about dinner back at the Forge! I was about to dig
into desser--"
</p><p>
&lt;snap&gt;
</p><p>
The sound caught the attention of those who were awake, and Jolan sat up
from his bed roll, rolled back his sleeves, stretched his fingers,
and peered into the darkness nervously.
</p><p>
"Just a scavenger I had my eye on," Amber confirmed with a glance behind her.
"You don't get out into the wide-open much, do you, Jolan?"
</p><p>
The human chuckled. "Nope. How did you know?"

[[DM: No excuses! Let the adventure continue. (I'm sick at home with the flu, what better opportunity to post a move? P.S. This post powered by BellSouth Fast Access ADSL. :)]]

As Amber knelt down to examine the area, looking for tracks, signs of a concealed hide-away, anything that might give her a clue as to where the halflings who'd made the tracks Xanter followed were, she heard a rustle in the bushes behind her and to the left. She rose, drew out her sword in a quick-draw, and spun to face the newcomers.

[[DM: The rest of the group is surprised, but Amber and her ranger-self isn't!]]

"Hey, watch where you point that thing, lady!" said a gruff voice. Xanter, Tilder, Jolan and Bell spun around to see what Amber had detected a moment earlier. Before them stood two halflings, armed with short sword and dagger, one in each hand. The one who'd spoke had grey hair and a grey, trimmed beard. The other seemed to be Tilder's age or a bit older. Both wore headbands on their heads similar to the one Xanter sported.

Stepping forward hesitantly, the older spoke again without waiting for a response from the group. "Xanter, for cryin' out loud what in all of Trassgar happened to you?"

[[DM: What do you do?]] 

440/1.30.01/Xanter
"I'm pleased to see you again Onearm... and Bilfin. Well, that is one of the main reasons we are here. I can't really explain it except to say I died, but yet I still live. Do not worry Onearm, everyone with me are my friends [I INTRODUCE EVERYONE TO ONEARM AND BILFIN.] Where's Rollin hiding?"

441/1.30.01/Tilder
[[Tilder]] tried to keep a low profile during the introductions. So Bilfin was the poor sot's name.... He wondered if the halfling would recognize him as the one who pilfered his purse when *Ounze!* robbed Syona's gang several years ago in a dark side street off Bar Alley. Probably not; the guy was so stinking drunk, Tilder recalled. If he hadn't stolen Bilfin's purse, any of the other bumbling Orcs could have.

442/1.30.01/Amber
[Amber] She relaxed a bit as she realized that these were members of Xanter's clan, but still felt a bit uneasy with the whole situation. She sheathed her sword, but for some reason she couldn't quite relax--not yet. She waited for Xanter to introduce her, when they were done with their greetings.

443/1.30.01/Xanter
[[Xanter]] "This is our lovely ranger and our party leader... Amber of the Third House. We can never hide anything from her Onearm," I say, making a slight joke, while my face remains totally emotionless.

[[OOC: Amber, please read my last post a second time. <smiles charmingly>]]
 
444/1.30.01/Amber
[Amber] nodded at the newcomers, waiting for Xanter to finish reacquainting himself with them before grilling them with all the questions burning in her mind.

[[OOC: mmm hmmm, very funny Xanter! :o)]]

?/2.9.01/ADM
>>> The 'Ghoul Quest' Continues >>>
[[DM]] Syona Onearm, who sported a curiously plural number of arms, bowed
as he was introduced to Amber, putting his blades away in a grandiose flourish
at the same time.  Bilfin followed suit, sheating his sword and dagger,
although his motions were more utility, less dramatic.  At Xanter's mention of
Rollin, Bilfin's face tightened with worry and he sighed.  Before he could
respond, however, Syona spoke up in a hurried voice.

[[Syona]] "Let us get out of plain sight--but more importantly, there is
someone who is very much looking forward to seeing you again, Xanter."
Then Syona turned his attention to Jolan.  "And if you don't mind, we have
need of your talents, Father...?" he pleaded to Jolan.

[[Jolan]] "Tru.  But call me Jolan.  I assume you have wounded?" Jolan
seemed to be all business around these folks; he seemed to know when there
was a time for fun and games, and when it was time to be serious.

[[Bilfin]] "Yes, we do!" Bilfin reported excitedly.  He stole a glance at
Syona, whom he'd cut off to talk to the Ikran priest.  He piped down a bit,
realizing his eagerness might have betrayed his worry.

[[Syona]] "Indeed," Syona continued, unangered in the least at having
been interrupted.  "We have wounded and we also have a bigger problem."
Syona extended his arm and indicated a gap between a pair of shrubs.
"But first things first!  Our immediate concern is right this way!"

Bilfin nodded to his clan leader and led the way.  Syona noticed Amber's
uneasiness with the situation and tried to convince her of the wisdom in
following his command as Jolan followed Bilfin.  Bell remained with Amber
who seemed to be considering the situation.

"If you're here it's because Xanter, miracle of all miracles, has somehow
survived the attack and brought you here to help."  Syona pleaded to Amber,
"I believe you must have great courage to come here to the aid of
a band of halflings here before you, despite our races' troubled history."  His
eyes donned a gentle but wise gaze.  "Come this way and I will explain all
I know.  I declare: any friend of Xanter Junip is an ally of Syona Onearm."

[[DM: Well, what say ye?]]
