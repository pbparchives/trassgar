<h3 align="center">The Ikra</h3>
Goal and Purpose of Faith:<br>
The <em>Ikra</em> has a clearly defined purpose--to eradicate evil, its minions, its
scurge and its darkness.  It's followers have but one goal, which is to counter the
spread of evil throughout the universe in order that they may live in harmony with the
world around them and the supreme being which they acknowledge but do not particularly seek
to know.  It is an ideal-centric following rather than a being-centric religion; as a
result we have chosen to dub it a "philosophy".  (This is soon to change--stay tuned for
details.)
<p>
The <em>Ikra</em> has been a part of Trassgarian society as far back as anyone living
can remember, and references to it can be found in the ancient texts of the land.  Temples
and Philosophical centers for the <em>Ikra</em>, also known as the Great Light, can be
found interspersed all over the realms of Trassgar, though interest and dedication to the
philosophy has been waning in the past few centuries.  
<p>
The Trassgarians have been bombarded with various other philosophies and religions in
the past several centuries as a consequence of the arrival of the many other races
which now help to populate Trassgar, not to mention the combination of the various
elven clans and their various permutations of the Great Light.  With this mixing of the
races and clans also came a questioning of philosophies, and with that, the aforementioned
decline in fundamental followers of the <em>Ikra</em>.  Notwithstanding, the Great Light
has remained the primary "religion" of Trassgar and its native population--the elves.
<p>
Within the tomes of the <em>Ikra</em> are listed the guidelines for its followers.
They include a list of basic guidelines, which according to the Great Light, are
necessary for anyone to avoid an Trassgarian purging.  [A purging is considered
some trauma or calamity aimed at returning the sufferer to his or her principles.]
They are:
<dl>
  <dt>Act on no evil meditation toward your fellow elven kinsmen.
    <dd>This literally means <strong>actions</strong>, such as striking, maiming, killing,
    or otherwise physically injuring another elf.
  <dt>Perpetuate no evil meditations and/or their consequences toward your fellow elven
  kinsmen.
    <dd>Though a roundabout way of saying it, this actually means to not stir the waters
    of discord and strife among elvenkind by voicing evil or untrue thoughts about fellow elves.
  <dt>Strive for harmony with nature.
    <dd>1. Do not kill unless from necessity.  This includes other humanoids.  Necessity
    has been determined to be, when concerning non-sentient beings, from need of food,
    clothing, money to provide such items, or threat to life and safety.  When concerning
    sentient beings, <strong>only</strong> when threat to life and safety, not only of ego
    but of others.
    <dd>2. Actively promote the well-being of the nature around you.

<h3 align=center><a name="Finty!">Infinity</a></h3>
<p>
The philosophy of Infinity is more of a mindset than an organized religion.  Indeed, often one
encounters this mindset in a follower of another faith.  Its true origins are shadowed in
obscurity, but legends from Forest's Edge claim a genesis in the earliest gambling halls
of Bar Alley, though this would seem to imply too recent an origin to account for the
belief's presence throughout Trassgar.  Popular among the lower strata of Trassgarian
societies (albeit now becoming fashionable in some wealthy atheistic cliques), this
philosophy appeals to the sense that no matter how hard one tries, one's fate is
inexorably tied to a randomness beyond one's control.
<p>
One image which is commonly conjured is that of a goddess (given by some the appellation
<EM>Infinity</EM>, but most often shortened to <EM>Finty</EM>) rolling the dice that control
one's fortune, be it good or bad.  Finty (if we may anthropomorphize this mindset for the
sake of clarity) is a fickle and deaf goddess, immune to the supplications of her subjects.
Indeed, "Finty favors no man," as the saying goes.  Nevertheless, more adamant adherents
to this mindset will profess some degree of influence over Finty, often through the
performance of arbitrary actions.  The skewed logic is as if by the sheer randomness
of their behavior, they may impinge a modicum of predictability in the rolls of Finty's dice!
