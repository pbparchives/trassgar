<strong>Re: faiths of Trassgar</strong>
<p>
Ok, Stacy and I have been thinking about how the
other races (non-elves) got to be on Trassgar,
and how this relates to the religious atmosphere
of the planet.  And, because of this
restructuring, the <em>Ikra</em> is now going to
officially be classified as a religion rather
than a philosophy.  The idea we've come up with
goes something like this: there is one supreme
being who populated the
planet Trassgar with elves, and influenced their
development, and was their protectorate.
These elves set up a philosophy/faith known as
the Ikra which is devoted to pleasing this
supreme being, which they sometimes call "The
Great Light," but rarely refer to this being
by name.
<p>
However, there were some lesser beings who were
jealous that The Great Light
had this planet all to himself, but because they
were less powerful than the supreme
being, they were not able to populate the
planet--the choice planet of this solar
system--with their own creatures and influence
their development.  To balance the good
of The Great Light and the Ikra, and realizing
that the elves could not be sheltered forever,
The Great Light allowed these other lesser beings
to bring in other races to the continents
of Trassgar, and influence their development.
These beings could not directly influence
the elves unless the elves searched them out,
but their races of course had free will and
were free to interact with the native Trassgar
elves.
<p>
The lesser beings left the solar system looking
for races to bring to Trassgar; they
could not create these beings, but rather had to
bring them to Trassgar.  Slowly, over the
centuries, the lesser beings returned with the
locations of the races they would bring,
and they set up magic portals among the various
continents to these other worlds.  From there
they led races from other planets in the universe
to Trassgar.  Thus the dwarves, orcs, humans,
halflings, and other humanoidal races were
brought to Trassgar and slowly added their
talents and unique abilities to the continents.
And of course, each of these beings influenced
their own species of choice.
<p>
By the way, this history is for player
information.  The inhabitants of Trassgar do
not know the exact details of the creation of
their world nor how the non-elven races
came to be on Trassgar.
<p>
<strong>Re: Weather</strong>
I'll have to think about the weather situation
later.  Obviously, there are river and ocean
currents--see Jerith's inaugural move for an
example of this, soon to come--but I'll have to
think about hurricanes.
<p>
<strong>Re: The St'eelcoil</strong>
<p>
I'll be sketching and doodling this week.  As
for the quest which retrieved it, I'll add to
the list an expansion of that particular
adventure.
<p>
<strong>Re: Solar System</strong>
<p>
I've already got one mapped out.  (Duhn duhn
duhn!)  I'll reveal details as far as inhabitants
of Trassgar would know them soon.  (Add that
to the list, too!)
<p>
All this, and no new moves from the DM this
weekend.  :(  Well, I've been working on the
latest Vortex move, maybe by NEXT weekend.
SORRY!
<p>
Hasta...<br>

<B>Re: polytheism</B><BR>
The very presence of multiple and prominent heavenly bodies would provide a fertile basis for polytheism on Trassgar, IMHO.  I'd written of
both concepts in a previous posting, but the connection didn't occur until later.  It could make an interesting foil for the Ikra.
<P>
<B>Re: Ikra</B><BR>
And on that subject, I appreciate the consistency of the lack of a name for the Ikran "supreme being," given that Ikrans don't seek to know 
this being.  OTOH, IMHO, the very personification
of supremity indicates otherwise.  Perhaps a more
consistent formula would call for a supreme "force" or "omnipresence."  Just my 2 electrums' worth....

Any hurricane or tornado season on Trassgar?

Can you scan us a picture, Ben?  Plus, for us newcomers, could you provide more details of the adventure in which the scepter was recovered?  (Gnash or Amber could have easily filled Tilder in on their journey.)  I was going to write "artifact".... Is it?
 And I missed who gets to carry this thing?<br>

To compare Earth's own religious evolution to that of Trassgar's, in my way of thinking, is not logistically sound.  First, it assumes that monotheism is factually at a higher level of religious evolution than polytheism, which, though true in our own wor
d's history, does not necessarily dictate that the same is true on other planets with life.  Second, the "fact" that monotheism is relatively late-coming on our own planet is debatable in itself.  Many theologians contend that there have been monotheistic
societies as long as there have been polytheistic societies on Earth, and that, in fact, if the Creation theory is true (which by their very trade most theologians will at the very least acknowledge is a possibility), then religion itself began on the pre
ise of monotheism.  So, I find that having a planet with a monotheistic society and the absence of polytheism is not strange, but an exploration of possibilities on this world other than those on our own.  What do you think?<br>

Welcome blue valk, er, Christine!
<P>
<B>Re: the astronomy issue,</B> a cursory scan of Tilder's
and the Vortex pages turned up three mentions of
<EM>moon,</EM> and two of <EM>sun.</EM>  
<P>
In chapter 4 of Tilder's saga, we read "...the wan light of the gibbous moons," so Trassgar indeed has more than one moon.  Since Tilder's saga 
later
sayeth "...smaller moon had not reached its zenith," we might assume 2 moons for Trassgar, at least visible during that night, but this does
not preclude the possibility of more.  
<P>
As regards sun(s), there is even more ambiguity:
in the last sentence of the latest Vortex installment, "...the sun set...," so we might assume the Trassgarian
system has only one star. On the other hand, this quote could 
just as easily imply that any other suns had already set.
Finally, I seem to recall that somewhere else two suns are mentioned.  I could be greatly mistaken, however.
<P>
<B>Re: religion,</B> it would seem Trassgar has one monotheistic belief system (The Ikra), and
one pseudo-theistic philosophy (nobody worships Infinity, since she's figuratively deaf, but there is that notion of some omnipotent force 
that controls destiny), but what surprises me is the lack (so far) of polytheistic religions.
After all, monotheism is relatively new on Earth.<br>

Well, Christine is coming out of hiding! Seriously, glad to have you writing, Christine.  The more the merrier!  I'm anxious to hear about Scurge's past, and to get a little more insight into her character as well.
<p>
As far as the religions of Trassgar go, the <em>Ikra</em> is not a christian religion, per se.  It is what it is--a quest for the good, the true, the noble, the pure, and the Light.  The followers of the Great Light acknowledge that there is a greater bei
g than themselves, and that that being  is served by them serving his/her ideals.  However, unlike Christianity on our own planet, the Great Light has not chosen the same ways of revealing itself to its people.  So, I think that assigning the term "pagan"
to either the <em>Ikra</em> or the Infinity or any other Trassgarian religion would be a misnomer, since our definition of "pagan" is by its very nature defined by the presence of Christianity, and retroactively, the physical presence of Christ.<p>

Well since everyone is writing I figured I might as well join in.  
Sorry to everyone for the delay in writing Scurge's background.   I know what it should say just haven't really had time to do as such.  
I know not many people know me or the SCURGE!!! , but realy she's as quiet as a mouse.  She really wouldn't hurt a fly.   Unless the fly attacked her with an assault rifle... and then that's when she takes out her TURBO charged AK-47 and exterminates the 
ouse of icky pests!!! MWAHAHAHA! But in all actuallity... she's really sweet!
Anyway, just wanted to say "good-show" to Ben for the cool Forum.
As for the whole religion thing you peoples mentioned... I've always noticed that most relgions in any role-playing game I've seen have always been paganistic (not to say in a bad term) Just that they've been based on a belief in gods and/or goddesses.   
ut that's only what I've seen. 
Poor poor Will, 
Five words:  No more prosac for you!<br>

Well, i think weather is very important.  I mean, take for example, you're trudging through the trassgarian forests, hunting down black sashes and boom, what happens?  it rains!  there goes your torch, and that nice italian leather armor, eh?  you COULD h
ve saved yourself by bringing your umbrella or perhaps your poncho but nooooooo.... didn't listen to your nice friendly weatherman....<br>

I'm glad that Infinity fits into your broader vision for the set of Trassgarian belief systems.
You're right in that it is akin to "lady luck," so to speak.  On the other hand, the presence of Finty fanatics adds a new twist to an old notion.  One of these loners who has figuratively fallen off the dark side of Finty would make an interesting charac

Nice idea about a guide to the Trassgarian planetary system.  I think I may have thrust two or three moons on us; I'll check the sources.  I think it would also be neat to throw two suns in too, after all, binary systems are far more abundant than lonely 
ones like Sol.  And most planets in Sol's neighborhood have a satellite plurality with smaller moons to boot.<br>

well, i would just like to inform the group of Trassgar's Climate Situtation.
Tomorrow we're looking at a partly cloudy sky over the black forest with a 30% chance of rain. Highs in the upper 70's, lows in the lower 70's.  
Those in the region of Ice City will be getting a warm surprise tomorrow thanks to a warm front sweeping in from the northern expanse.  It will be sunny with highs in the upper 30's with lows in the teens.
On the Other hand cactus ridge will see let another month without rain come to an end, making the record now 16 years without one drop.  The sky will be clear with highs in the upper 120's and lows in the lower 120's, with, ofcourse, a 0% chance of rain.
Residents in Furterville should be alerted of a flash flood warning in effect by the Trassgarian Weather Service.  Ofcourse, they will not be.  Heavy casualities are expected.

Well Dave, I think your Infinity idea is a good one, and I like that it's not a obsessive organized religion.  Reminds me of what many people attribute to "fortune" today!  And, the best part is, of course, that now we have a nice new Trassgarian curse wo
d! :)
<p>
So what do you think about the Ikra?  I created it as kind of the dominant organized religion in Trassgar, and had foreseen it as the <em>only</em> one for the elves...  however, I had thought that the other races in Trassgar might have their own philosop
ies, etc..  and that those might bleed over and influence the elven religion.  So, this Philosophy that you've introduced fits very nicely!  In short, I <em>like</em> it! :)<br>
