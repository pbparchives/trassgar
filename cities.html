<a name="cactusridge">
<font size="+1" color="#FF0000">Cactus Ridge:</font><br>
Set on the dry coast of the Rafaar Bay, Cactus Ridge is a thriving
port.  Set far apart from the dangers of the Black Forest, it is a safe
harbor for both upright businessmen and those that need to be inconspicuous.
It is said that the old timers here have information about everything and
everyone in the Trassgar Realm.
<p>
<a name="cysker">
<font size="+1" color="#FF0000">Cysker:</font><br>
A blah town with a blah schedule.  Cysker is far enough from the Forest
to avoid constant bombardment, but too close for a large family population.
Stragglers, missionaries, miners and a small number of families make up
this small town.<br>
The only tourist attraction here is a good night's rest, and a weapons
factory, where for the right bribe, anything you want can be acquired.
<p>
<a name="forestsedge">
<font size="+1" color="#FF0000">Forest's Edge:</font><br>
A small but hardy town accustomed to frequent barrages by the Kurl
barbarians, heavily armed townspeople, active weapons underground,
and assassins for hire.  Bar Alley is lined with the hottest nightspots,
and the hottest merchandise.  Kurl has spies everywhere--his bold enemies
must be careful in this town.  A very high volume of trading takes place
here.
<p>
<a name="furterville">
<font size="+1" color="#FF0000">Furterville:</font><br>
A large village that is family oriented.  Two roomy inns--one run
by a very old woman known for throwing rowdy travelers out on their
ears.  The other is run by a respectable mystic, who is often asked
to foresee small future happenings by the locals.  There are no bars
here, and no weapons are allowed in the Central Square.<br>
The city of Furterville has a <a href="furterville.html">rich history</a>.
<p>
<a name="himm">
<font size="+1" color="#FF0000">Himm:</font><br>
This town is named appropriately.  In this town, women are few
and far between.  Himm is a mining town, so the only women present
get paid--for treatment or gruff treatment.<br>
There are two bridges on the two roads from Forest's Edge to Himm.
One is very long, and prone to ambushes.  The other is quicker
to travel across, allowing less vulnerability to ambush.

<font size="+1" color="#FF0000">Ice City:</font><br>
<a href="cities/ice_city/index.html">Featured city page.</a>
<p>
<font size="+1" color="#FF0000">Kahdyr:</font><br>
Kahdyr lies in the
northestern region of Trassgar, in the north central portion of the
krimtree forests.  The people of Kahdyr live in cave dwellings and
treehouses built into the ancient krimtrees and the canyon walls
surrounding much of the ancient forests.  There is not a city, exactly,
rather small villages spread throughout the forest, with a central
meeting area near the temple of the <em>Ikra</em>.  The priests of 
<em>Ikra</em> serve as leaders and protectors of the locals.
To get supplies, you visit the homes of the traders, not a central
store.  Water is plentiful in the
forest, found in raging brooks, gentle streams, and glistening rivers
throughout the region.  With the mountainous terrain, there are many
spectacular waterfalls and vistas of the mountain range from high peaks.
Local wildlife include normal mountainous and water-dwelling creatures,
including some of the following: eaglesnerps, Jakiran yamitzes, and
dwarf dogs.  
<p>
Eaglesnerps are small furry creatures with
vestigial wings who, when their nest is full of snerplings and
approached by a predator, screech ferociously, flapping their wings,
swinging their tail, and bearing their fangs.  In all truth, they are
herbivores with very little fighting power in and of themselves.
However, they will fight to the death against overwhelming odds to
protect their young and/or their mate, and they are often joined in battle
by neighboring eaglesnerps who either hear or smell the call of battle.
Snerps are small, only about 14" long and 23" tall standing on haunches
at full maturity.  They can climb anything, using their tail as a fifth
limb, and usually nest in the branched of trees high on mountain crags
and cliffs, though they have been known to nest in canyons and gorges
as well.  Jakiran yamitzes are carnivorous catlike creatures who hunt
at night and sleep in dens during the day.  They prefer to sleep in
packs but hunt and wander alone.  They have an uncanny sense of smell,
allowing them to find others to bed down with at the end of the day, and
also facilitating the hunt.  While they will eat even the smallest
rodent when hungry enough, they enjoy the more challenging, larger kills.
They have six legs, the front four like any large cat.  The two in the
back are shorter than the rest, and do not touch the ground when the
yamitz is standing.  However, when sitting, they provide a springboard
that launches them quickly into chase of unsuspecting prey.  Their
thick, rough coat has little fur because of a thick layer of blubber
underneath the thick hide, but the skin is mottled with various shades
of brown in order to camoflage the yamitz from its own predators.  Dwarf
dogs are described in another section.
<p>
<a name="krom">
<font size="+1" color="#FF0000">Krom:</font><br>
Also a town of high trading, Krom is sometimes called Three-Road
Gorge.  Krom is set down in a gully where a deep lake once was.
Legend speaks of the great dwarven hero Krom Gnarly who killed
the Black Dragon there--but not before the dragon's death cry
shot out such a fire that it dried up the lake.<br>
It is a religious place of pilgrimage now, for dwarves and
the local peoples who remember the wrath of the dragon.  Portals
were put into place to make the pilgrimage easier for those
from outer far regions.  Because of its religious affiliations,
no fighting is allowed in Krom.  Anyone brawling is forced
outside the city for a twenty-four hour period, night or day.
(This happens frequently.  We are talking about dwarves, after
all!)

An excerpt from the adventures of Tilder the halfling and Amber
the she-elf:
<blockquote>
The town ahead sat surrounding the split of the Lanagg
river into its northern and southestern components,
pinpointed by the juncture it formed with the Furter River.
The two rushing currents wound
south from their disparate sources, and met at the fertile valley upon which
Amber and Tilder's horses now trod. Two Rivers' Forge, originally
settled by a collective of humans who farmed the irrigated valley,
became a hotbed of activity when a disgruntled dwarven family migrated from
the furnaces of Krom, and taught the humans how to shape the metals of the
land. 
<p>
Now, Two Rivers' Forge boasted the hottest furnaces and finest craftsmen
in northern Trassgar. At least the inhabitants were quick to make
those claims, Amber related to Tilder. Each knew of the town and had
traveled to it on occasion, but Amber took this opportunity to share the
"hidden history" of the town--knowledge imparted to her by none other
than the displaced dwarf, Gnashuphagnewtogius Gnarly. 
<p>
"In fact," Amber joked, "Gnash claims to have been part of that disgruntled
family of dwarves that got this place on the map." She grinned, and
noticed that her companion smiled, too.
