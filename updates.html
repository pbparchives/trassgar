<p>
[<font color="yellow">February 9, 2001</font>] Started a new page for
the relatively new side-adventure: <a href="ghoulquest.html">Ghoul
Quest</a>, starring Amber, Tilder, Xanter, and some NPCs.  I archived moves
from the <a href="http://clubs.yahoo.com/clubs/theforestsedgeforum">FEF</a>
for Vortex Quest and Ghoul Quest (Amber, Tilder, Xanter's adventures)
through September 29, 2000.  Should we call them the ER adventures (all 3
PC names end in "er"!)  I archived posts for Elf Quest (Darrin's adventure)
through February 8, 2001.
</p><p>
Also, added a page for <a href="cities/aquus_keep/index.html">Aquus Keep</a>, a
location on the <a href="world.html">Trassgar world map</a> some of the
PCs might be seeing soon.
</p><p>
Also, revamped front page a bit.
</p><p>
[<font color="yellow">January 19, 2001</font>] Welcome, Stacy, back to the
ranks of the Dungeon Masters.  The adventures of Olen and company continue
at the FEF today!  Also, posted all the moves to date (including a new one)
for Darrin.  Don't worry, Vortex Questers, I'm getting to you, too!  Also,
updated the world map with the location of the town of Sage (see Darrin's
saga).</p>
<p>
[<font color="yellow">January 9, 2001</font>]  Finished up the transcribing
of the adventures of Olen, Scurge, Stor and Gnash (under the direction of
the Almighty Mrs. DM, Stacy).  Read it and stay tuned for their further
adventures at the <a
href="http://clubs.yahoo.com/clubs/theforestsedgeforum">Forest's Edge Forum</a>,
the Yahoo! club for this campaign.  Also, added a scan of a
hill giant to the Graphics of Trassgar page.</p>
<p>
[<font color="yellow">October 2, 2000</font>] Added a scan of a
chaggrin grue elemental, of the type encountered at Himm mountain (c.f.
the Original Adventures), to the Graphics of Trassgar page.</p>
<p>
[<font color="yellow">September 29, 2000</font>] Changed the Players
menu link to also show a players menu frame with links to each player's
character sheet, as requested!  Also added a new "Graphics of Trassgar"
page, also accessible through the menu.</p>
<p>
[<font color="yellow">September 24, 2000</font>] Updated the
<a href="players.html">Players</a> page, and added some new story posts
to <a href="darrin.html">Darrin</a>'s page, <a href="vortex5.html">The
Vortex Quest</a> page, and <a href="xanter.html">Xanter</a>'s page.</p>
<p>
[<font color="yellow">August 18, 2000</font>] Added pictures of Two Rivers'
Forge.  Check out the newly updated <a href="cities.html">Cities of Trassgar</a>
page for details.
<p>
[<font color="yellow">August 12, 2000</font>] Added pictures of Eebnox the
golden dragon (to Olen2.10), a kech (to Vortex2.5).  The Vortex Quest is
moving right along at the
<a href="http://clubs.yahoo.com/clubs/theforestsedgeforum">FEF</a>
(a Yahoo! club with membership by invitation only).  Also, fixed
up the <a href="new.html">New Adventures</a> page to have links
to each sub-move.
<p>
[<font color="yellow">August 11, 2000</font>]
Wizards of the Coast releases Dungeons &amp; Dragons 3rd edition!  Get
your source books at <a href="http://bsc.edu/~bassaf/gnarly_dnd.html">The
Gnarly Sellers</a> D&amp;D section!  Eventually, I think we'll convert
this campaign to 3e, but for now we're still 2e.
<p>
[<font color="yellow">July 7, 2000</font>] I updated Vortex pages 3 and 4
with a couple of minor typos and the proper font for the 2RF humans.  Also
be sure to check out the
<a href="http://clubs.yahoo.com/clubs/theforestsedgeforum" target="_top">The
Forest's Edge Forum</a> for the ongoing continuation of the Vortex Quest.
<p>
[<font color="yellow">June 9, 2000</font>] The newest segment (a DM move) in
the Jerith and Stoybin storyline is uploaded.
<p>
[<font color="yellow">May 30, 2000</font>] Stacy and David have
collaborated to produce the next Vortex installment!  (Also,
a while back, Vortex3.6 was edited to correct a temporal
anomaly, Keptin.)
<p>
[<font color="yellow">April 20, 2000</font>] Well, so far I'm keeping with
my one move per month (minimum) new year's resolution.  Enjoy!  (Also,
corrected Vortex3.9 to include Bell (<em>nee</em> Boris') name.)
<p>
[<font color="yellow">March 14, 2000</font>] Added a new Character
Threads link on the menu frame for easier reading of a single character's
storyline.
<p>
[<font color="yellow">January 7, 2000</font>] All hail the first move
of 2000!
<p>
[<font color="yellow">August 30, 1999</font>] (1) Officially
converted Scurge to NPC-status.  (2) Stacy, a friend of mine from work
and I had a rpg session Saturday night, starring a whole new cast of
characters.  Look for the adventures of our characters,
Broadnax the mountain dwarf warrior and Dalim the sundered dwarf
warrior/priest, to
be somehow summarized/published right here in the Trassgar Saga.  Stacy
tells us that our adventure-in-progress is somehow connected to the rest
of the Trassgar Saga, but we've yet to figure it out!
<p>
[<font color="yellow">August 29, 1999</font>] Olen page 3 and move 11
has been linked up.  I think I saw Vortex 8 at a Circle K, eating jelly
donuts.  <font color="yellow">[Thank you, Will, for that entertaining update.
Now for the REAL update from the Almighty Mr. DM...]</font>  I owe Will
a couple of edits for Olen move 11, but you can read the present state of
it now if you wish.  Sorry, Will, tried to get to it tonight, but we're
just too pooped after staying up late last night!  Also as you notice, I
mucked with the contents frame.  Groovy!
<p>
[<font color="yellow">August 22, 1999</font>] I updated all experience points
for the latest moves.  Also, in case you missed it, Stacy
wrote the latest move for T'Asha.  AND, somehow Vortex move 8 has been zapped
into the void.  If you have a local copy, please let me know!
<p>
[<font color="yellow">August 3, 1999</font>] Alright!  We just won our first
award here at the ol' Trassgar Saga.  It is the <a
href="http://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/Alley/1100/award/winners.html">Times
Square Roleplaying Games Award</a>!  See our lovely graphic above and our
addition to the official award-winners-only webring below.  Long live Trassgar!
<p>
[<font color="yellow">July 18, 1999</font>] Modified the Storyline page
again.  Look at the bottom of the Storyling page for a list of abbreviations.
(Also uploaded Tobin move number 5!)
<p>
[<font color="yellow">June 20, 1999</font>] Welcome back,
<a href="slahm.html">Slahm the Barbarian</a>!
Evan will be joining us on-line, and apparently he really
means us this time.  Stay tuned, true believers!  <b>Also</b>, I moved and
modified the table of contents page Dave set up.  Now, when you click on the
"Storyline" link, it loads in the left frame, and links load pages in
the main frame.  I think it makes for an easier way to read the story.
If you don't like, I can revert back to Dave's original code.
<p>
[<font color="yellow">April 20, 1999</font>] I updated and expanded
the <a href="players.html" target="main">Players</a> page to include
NPCs, and supporting characters, as well as our heroes.
<p>
[<font color="yellow">April 15, 1999</font>] I like this color for
a background.  It's called darkseagreen.  <toothy grin>.
<P>
[<font color="yellow">February 3, 1999</font>] Jerith
has "gone NPC" on us.  The DM will now assume the writing role
for this character.
<p>
[<font color="yellow">January 20, 1999</font>] I tried fiddling
with the contents frame so that it wouldn't generate a pop-up
window, without putting the GeoGuide thing on it, to no avail.
(I moved it to another account, which of course prevented the
pop-up code from being inserted, but then all the links loaded
in the full window instead of the right frame.  Sigh.)  So I
caved in, and now we have the ugly GeoGuide in the contents
frame, too.
<p>
[<font color="yellow">November 5, 1998</font>] As you all
know by now, The Forest's Edge Forum has moved.  You can now
find it at
<a href="http://clubs.yahoo.com/clubs/theforestsedgeforum"
target="main">http://clubs.yahoo.com/clubs/theforestsedgeforum</a>.
Happy foruming!  I have removed functionality to the old Forest's Edge Forum
(GeoCities' Built-in Guest Book) such that you can no longer add to it.
You can still access the old posts by going to the old Forest's Edge Forum
location.  If you are not yet a member of the new forum, e-mail me and we'll
get you set up.  (I've restricted access to the new Forum so only approved
people can join/post etc.)
<p>
[<font color="yellow">October 17-18, 20, 1998</font>] T'Asha's storyline has
started moving... AND Olen's, AND Jerith's!!  AND FINALLY, The
Vortex Questers!!!!  Check 'em all out!  (P.S. I'll tally Experience Points
for this latest volley of awesome moves soon.  Stay tuned!)
<p>
[<font color="yellow">September 13, 1998</font>] Ok, we're back from
our travels.  Check out the new moves page this week for some terribly belated
story updates!
<p>
[<font color="yellow">August 16, 1998</font>] Experience points
are here, and so is <a href="jerith.html">Jerith</a>!  Also,
the <em>Ikra</em> has been slightly adjusted.  Read the latest
on the <a href="geobook.html" target="main">FEF</a> for details.
<p>
[<font color="yellow">August 15, 1998</font>] The <em>Ikra</em>
has been described in more detail.  Check it out and direct all
comments to the newly created <a href="geobook.html" target="main">FEF</a>!
<p>
[<font color="yellow">August 12, 1998</font>] Added a
<a href="geobook.html" target="main">guest book</a> for
players to scribe public comments about the game.
<p>
[<font color="yellow">August 9, 1998</font>] We have a new
character on board!  Please welcome
<a href="tobin.html" target="main">T'Asha</a> to Trassgar!
<p>
[<font color="yellow">August 8, 1998</font>] Check
out your characters in the days to
come for some well-earned and
long-overdue experience points.  Oh boy!  FYI, experience
points are earned for the following:
<ul>
  <li>successful ability / skill / proficiency rolls
  <li>effort in conflicts or conflict avoidance
  <li>treasure acquired
  <li>storytelling
</ul>
I will try to get everyone's characters up to date within a
week.
<p>
[<font color="yellow">July 19, 1998</font>] The
<a href="world.html" target="main">world map</a>
finally has some additions to it, and a
<a href="vortex1.html" target="main">new quest</a>
has begun for three of our heroes.
<p>
[<font color="yellow">July 1, 1998</font>] The Trassgarian
Planetary Society has recently published a
<a href="world.html">world map</a>.  Additions to this map
are in the works.
<p>
[<font color="yellow">June 29, 1998</font>] The Royal
Geographer (Stacy) has added a new city, <a href="cities.html"
target="main">Kahdyr</a>, and the contents frame was revamped.
<p>
[<font color="yellow">June 25, 1998</font>] I've been thinking
about opening up this game to complete strangers who happen
to stumble by and express interest.  If Evan and Kyle (or
anyone else from the original party) don't
want to play, I may just do that.  In the meantime, I've
been inviting other people I've role-played with in the past
to join in, but no new souls have signed up yet.  If you
are a complete stranger (ha!) and would like to play,
read the below section on <a href="#howtoplay">How to Play</a>.
I don't want TOO many more players, since
this is my first attempt at DMing an on-line game, and I
don't have oodles of time, but at least two more in
addition to the five of us presently would be nice.
<p>
[<font color="yellow">June 24, 1998</font>] Started a
<a href="rules.html" target="main">Rules Page</a> for help
in remembering rules for those of you without sourcebooks.  This
will be a source page in progress, so let me know what rules
you guys need help with and I'll summarize them on this page.
<p>
[<font color="yellow">June 1, 1998</font>] Finally penned
the first chapter of Olen, Scurge and Stor as they trek it
back to Forest's Edge.  It seems they've stumbled across
something which makes the plot rather thicken.  Ok Will and
Christine, now it's up to you to get those creative juices
flowing!
<p>
[<font color="yellow">May 31, 1998</font>] Modified the
character pages so that America Online users can view them.
Apparently AOL's web browser cannot interpret the JavaScript
code used in the character pages to generate the frames,
so I've coded the frames the old-fashioned way.  Let me
know if there are any other problems!
<p>
Added Scurge's character and text pages.
<p>
[<font color="yellow">May 13, 1998</font>] Olen has submitted his background,
and a skeleton character page with his background is now functional.
Still waiting on backgrounds for the rest of you guys!
If we don't get more of the original players to join in the on-line version,
I'll start opening up the game to some others--friends and perhaps even
complete strangers who somehow stumble across this adventure and take interest.
<p>
[<font color="yellow">May 9, 1998</font>] The transition from the original
adventures to the new adventures has been written and can be found on Stor's
page, designated as move one.
<p>
[<font color="yellow">May 4, 1998</font>] Be sure to check for new
background and saga additions by visiting the
<a href="new.html" target="main">New Moves</a> page.
<p>
[<font color="yellow">May 3, 1998</font>] Added a summary of
<a href="trassgar_houses.html" target="main">The Ruling Houses of Trassgar</a>,
and the first move in the <a href="new.html" target="main">New
Adventures of Trassgar</a>.  Now is the time to join in, guys and gals!
<p>
[<font color="yellow">May 1, 1998</font>] Added a JavaScript script that
rolls multi-sided dice on the contents frame to the left.  Thanks to Dave for
fixing the JavaScript script that I unsuccessfully tried to get working!
<p>
[<font color="yellow">April 23, 1998</font>] Added a survey of the
<a href="cities.html" target="main">cities of Trassgar</a>, and a brief summary
of the <a href="original.html">original Trassgar adventures</a>.
<p>
[<font color="yellow">April 22, 1998</font>]
David has signed up to play a new character which we'll work in to the story
line, and Will has decided to continue his character on-line as well.  Alright!
<p>
[<font color="yellow">April 9, 1998</font>] Today I heard from Kyle and
Evan (in that order, within a matter of minutes!) and both want to continue
this adventure on-line.  Excellent.  So the pressure's on, the rest of you.
Are you gonna let your character "go NPC" on ya?  Or will you decide his/her
future for yourself?  <a href="mailto:trassgar@geocities.com">Let me know!</a>
<p>
[<font color="yellow">April 7, 1998</font>] Moved the pages to a new location
at <a href="http://www.geocities.com">Geocities</a>, namely,
<a href="http://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/Labyrinth/7890"
 target="_top">http://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/Labyrinth/7890</a>.
This will allow me to grant access to the players so one can update one's
own character page(s).  Update your bookmarks!
<p>
[<font color="yellow">April 3, 1998</font>] Established <a href="index.html"
 target="_top">frame layout</a> of these pages.  Only 13 days until I get my
hands on the Trassgar Saga notes from Baton Rouge!  I've also been fiddling with
a good character page layout.  See <a href="stor.html" target="main">Stor</a>'s
page for the latest transmogrification.  ALSO, I haven't received any
backgrounds yet!  Come on, Will, lead the charge and give me that history of
Olen Orpheus which I know you've written!
<p>
[<font color="yellow">March 12, 1998</font>] Added current characters listing.
This is from memory, guys.  Correct my mistakes, please!
<p>
[<font color="yellow">March 3, 1998</font>] Site begun!  Due to
the success of the
<a href="http://www.geocities.com/Area51/Rampart/7427/frames.html"
target="_top">Tunnels & Trolls</a> adventure I'm currently a
part of (see Taran SniperOrc Dracon, my character), I've decided
to try to finish up an adventure I ran in 1996 and 1997 with
some family and friends.  Alright!
