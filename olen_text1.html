<font color="yellow">Olen Orpheas half-elven thought that it was definitely his bad
luck which had caused the rope bridge to collapse from under him, and an even worse turn
of fate that he'd been on the side of the bridge that <em>wasn't</em> on the other side.</font>
He had almost resigned himself to the fact that he wasn't going to ever have his way in this
land of Trassgar.  How he missed the grasslands of Terynios, the comfort of his own countryside!
But his journeys in Trassgar weren't all misfortune and sorrow.  He had the golden eyes to
prove that he'd been changed, for the better, he hoped.  And he had the companions to prove
that he wasn't going to be alone, or friendless.  In addition to his friends from home which
traveled with him on this foreign planet--he could tell by the constellations that he wasn't
on Aalam anymore--he had made new friends.  Specifically, he was hoping to make really good
friends with a particular new friend.  Olen thought it fitting that a thief by trade had stolen
his heart.
<p>
<em>"What am I, crazy?"</em> Olen thought to himself.  He'd known her but for a few
months, and already he couldn't keep himself from thinking about her!  He was thankful
for Stor's company, as the three of them traveled the long way home, east around the Lanaag
river.  He'd feel quite uncomfortable if it were just Scurge and himself.  How would he
ever make hours of conversation with this buff woman who had captured his attention?
<p>
"So, Stor," Olen spoke, breaking the silence.  Since leaving the bridge behind, the three
of them had barely spoken to one another.  "How is it that you always keep falling down
from high places?"
<p>
Stor turned to face him, and blushed.  "Well, it's not like <em>I</em> made that bridge snap
in half!  It was probably your weight and all your stupid spell components that made the ropes
break, you dolt!"  With that retort and a jab to Olen's side, Stor smirked and glanced
at Scurge.
<p>
"You guys crack me up."  Scurge barely managed to finish her sentence before she started
laughing.
<p>
Olen wasn't amused.  Stor was obviously happy at having embarrassed his friend.
<p>
Several hours and many wise-cracks later, Olen's keen eyes picked up
a stack of smoke drifting from up ahead, down the river bank.  It was approaching dusk, and
he hoped that he had just spotted a place to rest the night, or at least get a good meal
before journeying some more.  As they walked closer,
they could easily recognize the establishment ahead as a tavern.  They began to pick
up the scents of some kind of meat roasting over a flame, and could hear merriment from
within the walls of the small building.  It occured to Olen that it was pretty odd to find
a tavern in the middle of the grasslands, especially one so close to the river and
miles away from civilization.
Amber didn't mention to them that they'd encounter anything on their way
around the river, except maybe a fungal snake or two.
<p>
<img src="graphics/wetsnake.gif" align="center">
The name on the wooden-carved hanging sign read "The Wet Snake."
<p>
"Odd name for a tavern," Scurge suggested.
<p>
"Not odd enough for my empty stomach!  Let's get some grub, guys."  Stor ushered himself
into the establishment, passing a few content elves lounging on the deck chairs on the deck.
<p>
Inside The Wet Snake was a typical night tavern scene.  A nice sized-fire, centrally located
and surrounded by a wall of bricks, was indeed cooking up a fine meal of roasted something
or other.  It smelled good, even if he didn't recognize it.

<p align="center">* * *<p>

It, Olen found out, was a Trassgarian deer native to the grasslands.  But this deer had grey
skin, and tasted like chicken.  "I guess
if we want to enjoy the taste of venison, we'll have to go chasing some fowl!" Stor joked,
stuffing his mouth with deer-kabob pieces.  <font color="yellow">[This meal has cost the
three of you two silver each, and Scurge, the only one with any coinage, foots the
bill.]</font>
<p>
Scurge laughed at that, too.  <font color="yellow">[Charisma check, Stor.  Roll=4.  Yea!]</font>
Olen became slightly jealous.  She was laughing at Stor's jokes
a lot more than his own.  But he didn't give up the pursuit just yet.  "Hey, Stor," Olen
said, smiling mischievously, "go get us a round of ales.  It's your turn to convince
the bar tender that we can handle our liquor."
<p>
"Uh, just some water for me," Scurge said to Stor, as the archer stood up, still laughing
at his own deer-chicken joke."
<p>
As Stor moved over to the bar, Olen followed him for just a few seconds, and was about to
turn his attentions back to Scurge when he noticed a man sitting at a table near them.
It wasn't his scarred face that caught his attention, nor was it the sheathed long sword he had
lain on the table in front of his plate of dinner.  It was the piece of cloth tied around his
left leg.  A black piece of cloth.
<p>
<em>"One of Kurl's henchman!"</em> Olen thought to himself.  He could feel his pace quicken.
<em>"What is one of them doing here?"</em>
<p>
As if in answer, the man wiped his mouth on his leather sleeve and rose from the table.  His
leather skirt hangings covered his legs, and his black sash, as he stood.  Taking
his sword with him, he headed over to the bar.  He was fumbling in a pouch, and Olen could
hear the chime of coins over the quiet murmer of the subdued crowd.  After paying his tab,
he walked over to a slightly elevated platform on the far side of the room.  By the time Stor
returned with their drinks, Olen had sereptitiously pointed out his discovery to Scurge, and
the man, taking center stage, had the focused attention of the majority of the patrons.
<p>
"Citizens of Trassgar, my name is Korricks," the man began, speaking
with a rich human accent, "and I've a complaint."
Korricks paused for an obvious dramatic effect.  Olen and Stor looked at each other,
and Olen mouthed the words "black sasher" to Stor.
Stor's blue eyes widened with worried recognition.
"It's a complaint against the weak ruling houses of this land that've allowed our
families and villages to fall into ruins.  It's a complaint that stems from the many
trials I've endured to even be here tonight, to speak with you."  With that last phrase, he
withdrew his sword from it's scabbard.  It was only half a sword, cracked mid-blade and
tarnished.
<p>
"This blade represents the people of Trassgar.  They are broken, tired, and waiting for
a great leader to make them whole."  He displayed the sword in front of him with a sad
look on his face.  "Not even I could defend my family and farm against the evils that hide in
the shadows during the day and prowl in the darkness of night.  Klaxton Kurl is that great
leader.  I have pledged to him my loyalty, my life, and I ask you to do the same.  Only
then can Trassgar rise from the depths o' despair and enter a new era of prosperity!"
<p>
Olen looked around the room.  Everyone was staring at Korricks, and none seemed to display
any disbelief.  <em>"How can they believe this idiot's lies?"</em> he wondered to himself,
not daring to display his shock such that he stick out in the crowd of seeminly eager
listeners.  He sent worried glances toward his companions, and as Korricks sheathed his
weapon, he slowly reached for his staff which he'd rested against the wall to his left.
<p>
"If you would agree with me, I ask you to join me.  Meet me in the 'morrow mornin' at the river
Lanaag's bank near here, and I'll tell you more.  We can overcome the oppressive goverment,
but only if we band together, and gather in the safety of Kurl's fortress.
Thanks for your time, and for comin' to this recruitment meeting."
With that, Korricks stepped down, nodded to several men standing near the stage,
and headed for the door.  The men to which he'd motioned followed him out, and the silence was
broken by the murmurings of The Wet Snake's patronage.
<p>
"Do you believe that guy?" Scurge said softly.  The evil he's talking about is caused by
Klaxton's influence, not the elven ruling houses!"  Stor and Olen agreed.  Even though
they were still relatively new to the land, they knew the major powers and their influences.
Amber had taught them enough, and they had witnessed--Stor especially--the corruption that
Kurl and his army was spreading.
<p>
"What I don't understand is how these people don't run them out of here.  I guess they don't
know." Stor said calmly, trying to hide his emotion.  A bar maid walked by and picked up their
empty plates.  Some of the patrons headed out the door, Stor went back to the tender
of bar and inquired about lodging, and Olen and Scurge sat staring intently at the wooden
table between them, thinking.  What would they do?
<p>
<font color="yellow">[Indeed, what do you do?  Will, Christine, you take it from here!  Be
creative and have fun!]</font>

Stor, having returned empty-handed in his search for a room, joined Olen Orpheas
and Scurge at the wooden table.  They were suddenly very aware they were
being watched.  They could almost feel the pro-Klaxton sentiment oozing around
them, and the breath of the patrons of the bar breathing down their back.  All
tried to look natural.
<font color="yellow">[Cha checks.  Olen: 5 beats a 14, Scurge: 7 beats a 10,
Stor: 17 doesn't beat a 13]</font>  But soon enough, their fellow
drinkers began to eye them even more intently, and the barmaid ignored Stor's
hails.  It was Olen who first thought to speak up about leaving.
<p>
"Hey, um, guys," he muttered quietly.  "I'm thinking about leaving.  I'd enjoy
everyone's company."  The other two nodded and finished off filmy drinks, and the
three stood up to make their leave.
<p>
"Yeah, I didn't like the beer in this place anyway," Stor said in a loud
voice, again trying to act natural.
<font color="yellow">[Cha check.  Stor: 14 doesn't beat a 13.  Stor's nervousness
is definitely sticking out like a sore thumb.]</font>
<p>
"Me neither," said a large half-orcish patron of the bar, sitting at a table
with another gruff looking fellow, "I think I'll be going as well.  Would you
like to accompany me, Chonk?"
<p>
His comrade responded.  "Yes, I believe I will,
Rooty.  There's someone I think I'll be meeting up with outside," Chonk said,
eyeing Olen's buddies.  
<p>
Almost on impluse, Stor tried to sit down again, but Scurge's strong grip
grabbed Stor's armpit and yanked him back to his feet, whispering, "If it's a
fight they want, it's a fight they'll get."  A determined look from Olen's
golden eyes bolstered Stor's fear of getting the snot beaten out of him.  Olen
muttered something under his breath.  Stor was about to ask Olen what it was
he had said, but decided not to break the stifling silence.  Perhaps the
spellcaster had something up his sleeve.
<p>
As Scurge's vice-like grip dragged
Stor out the door, he gained a little confidence as he saw Olen fiddling with
his fingers.  He was hoping that it was perhaps an 'automatic destroy people
with bad intentions spell,' but he knew that even Olen's magic, as confident as
he could be, was not a match for both half-orcish bullies.
<p>
Olen, on the other hand, strode proudly toward the doorway behind Scurge, and
slipped his hands out of the wall of fog spell's formation.  He had but one more
intonement to mutter and a pinch of split dried peas to flick
before a thick wall of fog would blind the entire bar
population.  That left only one or two bargoers too close to the bar's
entrance.  Olen was sure Scurge and Stor could take care of them if they
caused any interference.  All he had to do was keep his concentration until he
could mutter- "kala" and bam- the spell would enact.  He squeezed his eyes for
a second to clear his mind and looked up.
<p>
He nearly ran into Scurge.  She and Stor stood at the bar door.  She had a
hand on her long sword, still in it's scabbard.  Stor was reaching clumsily
for his sheathed short sword.
<p>
Korricks and his two henchmen
<font color="yellow">[all leather armor, AC 8]</font>
blocked the entranceway.  Olen's heart jumped
twice and he nearly audiably gasped.  The first time was because of the shock
of seeing Korricks again... and so close.  His second heart's jump was for the
spell--he'd lost it.
<p>
<font color="yellow">[Intiative: We=4, Korricks and co: 10]</font>
Scurge took one quick look around her--three bullies up front, two plus any
number of more behind her.  A slight impulse of claustrophobia took over, and
before she knew it, she was charging ahead,
<font color="yellow">[Scurge needs 12 (THAC0 - Korricks AC).  AR=11 +2 (charging)
+2 (tumbling) -2 (two attacks) = 13.  Pow!]</font>
giving Korricks a swift kick to the shin and
<font color="yellow">[AR=5 +2 +2 -2 = 7.  Whish!]</font>
attempting to jam her sword hilt into his gut.
Stor followed her lead and burst through the new
opening in the doorway... right into one of Korricks' henchmen.
But the intertia of his charge was enough
<font color="yellow">[Stor needs 9 (THACO - henchman AC).  AR=12.  Pow!
Str check=9 beats a 13. Yea!]</font>, and measly
Stor plowed right through the surprised 250 pound escort, knocking the bully
on his back.  Confusedly, Olen, with staff in hand but spell-less, charged
right into Korricks and
<font color="yellow">[Str check: 17 doesn't beat a 13.  Waugh!]</font>
stopped there, stunned as Korricks stiffened against Olen's impact.  
<p>
Behind him he heard hurried footsteps and in his peripheral vision he saw the
remaining henchman reaching for his club.
<p>

<p>
<font color="yellow">It didn't take a genius to realize that he was in
a less than advantageous situation.</font>  With Scurge and Stor out of
sight, he couldn't rely on their intervention, and Olen knew that he
couldn't possibly fight his way through Korricks, not to mention the
other large individuals beginning to make their way over.  He needed
a plan, and fast.
<p>"Look, I don't want any trouble.  I just want to be on my
way." Olen managed.  He thought he sounded more confident than he felt.
He could feel the stares of the tavern patronage, more inquisitive than
hostile, as Korricks considered his words.  But something about the way
the area folk were watching them made him feel diconcerted, and he
could feel sweat beginning to collect in the small of his back.
<em>"I'm just nervous because Korricks may decide to use me for a
training exercise for his new recruits,"</em> Olen thought
feverishly, <em>"I've been in tight spots before.  I can shake this
feeling..."</em>  But even as he said it, a bipolar paralyzation of
both terror and shame seized him as he unwillingly recognized a
component within the gazes
directed his way.  Memories of tragic stares and anguished glances
filled Olen's mind.  The evening stroll he had taken in the ruins of Gonduran.
The exercises in the wood near Wen Keep.  The errands run in Faild.  In
each instance, the elves had not seen him, but seen through him.  They
had visions of the young magician who had made them know fear and
trembling...
<p>
"No one here wants trouble.  Just tell your friends not to be so <em>rude
</em> next time!  We don't appreciate newcomers who shove, hit, and
kick their way through innocent gatherings."  And with that, Korricks
turned to finish his conversation with a fellow human, leaving Olen
to his own devices.
<p>
Olen continued on his way through the double doors.  With the last sweep
of his eyes across the room, he looked again for the slightest
hint of haunted despair.  But this time, he saw none.
 
<center>____________</center>

Scurge headed for the edge of the wood.  <em>This looks like a good
place to regroup,"</em> she thought as they hurried away from the
tavern.  Once camoflaged by the dusky shadows of the outer rim of
trees, Scurge and Stor eyed the Tavern nervously.
<p>
"Olen must not have made it." Stor said, alerting Scurge to the obvious.
<p>
"I know," she replied, her face betraying the concern she felt rising
up in her gut.  They were both aware that they were stating and restating
the obvious, but the dialogue, however pointless, calmed them with
the appearance of normalcy.  
<p>
Minutes passed.  The moons gently bathed the night in luminescence and
the night creatures began to stir.  The silence weighed heavily on Stor,
who had been simulating rescue plans in his mind, only to realize that
if Olen was indeed a prisoner, any attempts to rescue him tonight
would be futile.  They were outnumbered, out of their element, and
out there in the cold, growing colder.
"Well?  What are we going to do about this?" Stor said,
breaking the forest's lull.
<p>
"I have no idea," she replied, "I have no idea."
<p>
Turning their eyes toward the tavern, they continued to watch for their
compatriot.<br>
<p>

Olen looked around the front of the tavern.  He couldn't see, nor could he remember where Scurge had gone, or where Stor had hid.  Although he was no longer faced with the immediate danger of getting thrashed, he still felt a very unnerving sense of danger, mostly generated by the extreme pro-Klaxton sentiment.  
<p>
"Well, perhaps Klaxton was the best thing for Trassgar.  No, what am I saying?" Olen thought to himself as he began to walk warily down the alleyway.
<p>
"Kurl's men have murdered, raped... back on Aalam, only a black elf would do such a thing."
<p>
Olen paused a second in midstep, contemplating that very thought.  It seemed funny he would think that now.  Of all times, why would he now remember his long-lost home.  Before his transport here Olen had been rebuilding a life, and helping to rebuild a kingdom... one that he had destroyed.  <font color="yellow">[see Olen's
<a href="olen_background.html" target="text">background</a> if
you're not quite catching this hazy-edged flashback]</font>
<p>
Olen resumed walking.  He thought calling Scurge's name, but it would prove too risky.  Perhaps they were being attacked right now, or in dire need of his assistance.  Perhaps they had already been attacked, and Olen's hesitant thoughts on his past homeland had doomed his two comrades.  Perhaps...
<p>
Olen stopped again, shaking his head.  His heart was racing and his palms sweaty.  He took a weary sidestep, placing his staff at an angle against the stone alley wall and resting against the soft wood.  What was happening?
<p>
<center>____________</center>

Scurge stepped back from the window again.  She and Stor hid behind a wooden crate in a small shack across the street from the tavern. In haste, she and Stor had trucked it back into the small village and took up this strategic surveillance spot.  But she feared she was too late.  Korricks was gone.  Olen was too, and she dared not to go back into the bar asking for the young magician's whereabouts.  She knocked the back of her head softly against the wall, and looked to the ceiling.  She crossed her arms and waited.
<p>
<center>____________</center>
<p>
Olen collected his thoughts, calmed his nerves as much as he could, and decided to keep walking away from the bar.  Perhaps his comrades were hiding in the dense forest surrounding the small cicularly-oriented village, the tavern of which being the most prominent building.  He reached the forest.  Nothing.  The giant Trassgarrian flies buzzed up in the trees, and every now and then a peice of bark would drop as the flies sucked the juices right out of the trees.  Luckily, this breed of flies didn't have a taste for animal flesh.
<p>
Olen circled the village a bit, wandering around the backside of the bar, still very nervous.  <font color="yellow">[Wisdom check- 2 beats a 13]</font>  Suddenly, Olen was very aware he was being watched.  He suddenly realized he had known it all along, in the back of his mind, but perhaps had somehow ignored the fact!
<p>
"I must be going mad now," he hastily thought, has a tried to look natural and move as
quickly as possible.  But, thanks to nerves, he failed miserably.
<font color="yellow">[Charisma check- 18 doesn't beat a 14.  man o man...]  </font>
<p>
Perhaps it was his mindless haste or bad luck, or perhaps a mix of both, but
his foot caught squarely into the curve of a root, one which he could've
sworn wasn't there before, and fell <font color="yellow">[Dex check again- 19 doesn't
beat a 16.  well crud...]</font> flat on his face in the soggy underbrush of the
forest night.  He let his staff fall to the ground beside him, and seriously let the
thought rest in hs mind to stay there all night.  He knew he couldn't, and with
desperation tried to stand as quickly as possible.  But he heard the footsteps
behind him, and each one visibly shook his body.  
<p>
"Orpheas," a male voice echoed in his head.
<P>
Olen shuddered in fear, gasped and weezed in distress, and turned to face his stalker.
<p>
An extended hand reached for him.  Out of instinct and a desperate attempt to look
natural Olen extended his hand to shake it.
<p>
At once, Olen relaxed.  A feeling of warmth and ease spread from the stranger's hand,
and a soothing tone emanated from his voice. Olen's throat was not longer constricted, but
something seemed very, very wrong.  He couldn't lay a finger on it, nor could he
identify the stranger's accent.  He knew he's heard it before... but where?
<p>
"Greetings Orpheas.  My name is Abath.  I've come to take you home."
<p>
<center>____________</center>
<P>
"That's it, I've got to go find him, now."  Scurge picked up her scabbard, tied
it to her belt, and headed for the door.  Stor contested. "Are you sure?  I mean, aren't
we kinda in trouble?" 
<p>
Scurge spun around, infuriated.  
"HE'S OUT THERE ALL ALONE, STOR!  Don't you get it?!  He's in more danger than we are!"
<P>
Stor was silent.  He was shocked.  He didn't expect such a quick and strong response, and,
even more surprisingly, he didn't expect Scurge, of all women, to show emotion.
Towards Olen.  Stor had known Olen since the very beginning of his reculturization, and
never, never had a woman expressed any emotion toward him, beyond sheer acquaintenceship.
Maybe it was just some strange, very strange, high-stress over-emotion reaction.  Surely,
Scurge, one of the poorest excuses for outward feminimity and cuddle-ishness, could
not seriously care for Olen in a way beyond sheer teamwork!
Nevertheless, Stor got up, strapped his quiver back on, and, inspired but this huge opened
window of insight into Scurge's life, followed the brave human theif out the door, and
into the wilderness.

<font color="yellow">Olen Orpheas swallowed audibly
from his position on the ground, one arm stretched backwards to support his weight,
and the other hand extended upwards in a handshake with a tall, hooded stranger.</font>
At least
Olen did not know him.  Olen broke off the handshake and instinctively reached for his
fallen staff.  He felt uncomfortable that Abath knew his name, and addressed him only
as "Orpheas."  Olen spoke up tentatively.
<p>
<font color="yellow">[Int (17) check to perceive that this man is clearly his elder:
rolls 19.  duh!]</font>  "How do you know me, Abath?"
<p>
Abath looked surprised.  Did not this young mage realize his power and stature?  Had he
underestimate Orpheas, or perhaps mistakened this man for he whom he sought?  Perhaps
he should stop conjecturing and get on with his address.  "I know of you, Orpheas," Abath
continued, pulling the hood back from over his head, "and have been sent here to bring
you back to Aalam.  To your home.  To your rightful place among the mages of your native
land."
<p>
Just then, with the turn of Orpheas' head, Abath saw the moons' light reflected in a
pair of golden eyes.  Abath raised a thin eyebrow in curiosity.  "Ahh, Orpheas, please,
rise, and walk with me.  Your friends and I have much to discuss."
<p>
Again, Abath extended a hand to help Olen raise up.
<p>
<center>* * * *</center>
<p>
Scurge and Stor, thankful at first at having found Olen in the woods along the riverbank,
paused just out of earshot--human earshot, that is.  They had found Olen, half-sprawled
on the ground, and also another man, who seemed to have their half-elven friend at a
disadvantage from his position standing tall, robes rustling in the slight breeze of the
night.
<p>
"We should do something," Stor remarked quietly to his companion.
<p>
Scurge glanced at the archer, and back again at the situation before her.  While the stranger
did not seem to be causing Olen any harm she was still wary of the situation.
<font color="yellow">[Wis (13) check for a correct gut feeling, rolls 17.  Doh!]</font>
"I think Olen is in trouble, and needs our rescuing," she said quietly, unsheathing a dagger.
<p>
<em>"Didn't I just say that?"</em> Stor thought to himself, sighing.  "Agreed.  At this
range, I can club him with a battering arrow easily," Stor offered.
It'd be a lot less messier than your blade in his back."  He paused, and smiled.  "A lot
less deadly, too."
<p>
Scurge considered that for a moment, and relented.  "Ok, we'll try it your way, first.  This
time."  She gave Stor a friendly wink, and re-sheathed her dagger.
<p>
Stor reveled in this opportunity to show off his archery skills.  Quickly retrieving
from his pack <font color="yellow">[Dex (16) check for deftness: 6.  Schinngg!]</font> a
bundle of arrows, he selected one with a heavy, blunt end.  Scurge couldn't figure how that
arrow could fly, but Stor knocked the arrow, aimed high--
<p>
--"Hurry, he's going to magick-zap Olen!" Scurge noticed the man reaching out to Olen with
his arms--
<p>
--and fired.  The flat headed arrow sped toward it's intended target, and connected
with the back of the man's skull.  <font color="yellow">[THAC0 of 12, +2 for point blank

<p>
<center>* * * *</center>
<p>
Olen eyed the outstretched hand; but before he had an opportunity to resolve
the ongoing debate in his mind, Abath's countenance suddenly blanked, and he slumped to the
ground.
