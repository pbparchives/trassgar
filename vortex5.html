Sheathing his sword, Xanter helped with Mort and Bell.</font>  "Wow Amber, 
you popped Jole's head off like a cork off a wine bottle!  Oh, and he used 
to be a friend," Xanter said, suddenly realizing what they had done and
feeling bad about it.
<p>
"I'm sorry that he was a friend," Amber said, trying to be sympathetic, 
"but unfortunately we don't have time for any mourning. There was some 
moaning in there that wasn't coming from Jole. We need some information 
and then we need to make some quick decisions. Who are you, what 
happened to you, and how did you get here?"  Amber and Xanter locked eyes
for a moment.
<p> 
* * *
<p>
Back in The End, Tilder got up, shedding Olen's blanket faster than a strike
of a Trassgarian fungal snake, and ran into the office to check on the 
poor nameless mortician.  He unsheathed banal, unenchanted
short sword to bolster his nerves.
<p> 
* * *
<p>
Outside, Xanter spoke. "Yeah, Jole's dead, I'll get over it I guess.
My name is 
Xanter; as you can tell I'm a halfling. Last I remembered, I died.
I don't know any more than you do.  Maybe it'll 
come back to me I hope. I'm more than willing to help you! What is your 
name?"  The pace at which Xanter spoke was a bit dizzying, but Amber managed
to take it all in despite the confusion of Xanter's tale.
<p> 
* * *
<p>
Leaving Amber and John to drag the fainted men to the outside,
Tilder gripped his sword tightly, and crossed the threshhold into the office.
Some moaning from the bodies on the table--but no movement yet that
he could see--caused him to expedite his reconaissance into the room.
Tilder hurried over the man on the ground, probed his neck, and detected
a faint beating.  He sighed with relief.  The thief put down his sword
where he could grab it quickly, gently rolled the man onto his back,
and discovered that the man's eyes were wide open with fear.
His head was bruised and his nose was bleeding--probably from crashing
on to the floor--but his major injury was the nasty slice in his throat.
Tilder uncorked his healing potion, and offered it for the man to drink.
<p>
"My name is Tilder, and I'm here to help! It's a healing potion!"
The man swallowed with great difficulty, and the magic of the potion took
effect <font color="yellow">[1d8 = 7 hit points regained]</font>,
closing the wound.
<p>
The man tried to speak, but he seemed unable to form the words, as if
his vocal chords were frozen. Just then, the moaning in the main part of
the room grew louder, and Tilder realized his time was running out.
<p> 
* * *
<p>
"My name is Amber, and this is John. That was Tilder," Amber
spoke, gesturing to Tilder who had just skipped back inside.
"I wish we could have met under calmer, more normal circumstances."
<p>
"We pulled you and twenty others of your kind from the rivers
of the Furter," John introduced himself by way of brief history.
"You were all dead, but now you seem to be coming back to life,
or un-life. 'Jole' as you call him, was the first, and from the sound of
it, you and he won't be the last! Do you remember anything at all?" As John
spoke, the two other workers who were in the field rushed up to help revive
Bell and Mort. John sent one of them up the hill south of the building to
get help.
<p>
"Yes," Amber continued, looking at Xanter. "Anything you could say at this point
would help! What are we up against?"
<p>
"Right now, I'd say we're up against some of the toughest thieves
and fighters I know, only now they seem to be mindless--if Jole is a good
example of the lot. I don't know why I'm not mumbling around trying to
rip your head off, although I have to admit--" Xanter interrupted himself
with a seeming involuntary coughing spasm, and continued when he could.
"It is difficult to think
straight." He paused, and continued after taking in a labored breath.
"Onearm would be sad to see us in such a state--yes, that's it!  Onearm--we
are for him! I remember, ah, I remember, frell it, I can't remember anything
else." Xanter hit his own head with his hands as he tried to remember,
and ripped off his skull cap.
<p>
"Yes, Tilder recognized the headband you all wear...." Amber spoke,
her voice trailing off as she pitied the not-quite undead halfling before her.
She noticed that Xanter's face wasn't quite the typical halfling face,
discounting for the moment his gruesome features and streaks of purple, as his
visage wasn't covered with stubble, with bushy eyebrows and long sideburns.
She stored that piece of information in the back of her mind, and returned
her thoughts to the present. "John, we need help. If these halflings
are coming back to life, as undead, we could use the powers of a priest
who might have an effect on them."
<p>
"Undead... Right! I sent Kole for the Constable, but you're right.
I know just the man, and he should be upstairs at this very moment." Just then,
an awful scream was heard from inside The End. "Ulp, that sounded like him!"
John spoke grimly.
<p>
* * *
<p>
The scream caused Tilder to grab his sword quickly and bounce to
his feet. From his vantage point in the office, he could see out into the
main part of the room, and also into an alcove set into the northeast corner.
A man in grey robes was standing there, clearly shocked. Tilder could see
why, as two more staggering un-dead halflings had re-awakened and were
staggering toward him. The man had a gold chain about his neck with a holy
symbol dangling from it, and some papers in his shaking hands.
<p>
Tilder's eyes met those of the priest who had just come
upon the re-animated halflings.  He thought he saw fear in the priests
eyes for a moment, but then the human gained control of his senses.
Calmly, he rolled the papers and tucked them into his belt, while the
two undead halflings approached menacingly.  The priest's presence
seemed to increase by an order of magnitude as he sucked in a breath
of air, squinted his eyes, then closed them.
<p>
* * *
<p>
Xanter adjusted his helmet as Amber tensed her muscles,
as if preparing them to swing her sword once again.  "Going back
in there?" he asked.
<p>
"You bet, Xanter.  I intend to keep those alive today
on that same side of death."  With that, she sprang back toward
The End, holding her sword at the ready.
<p>
Amber entered Tilder's field of vision just as Tilder was trying to
get the man he'd helped to his feet.  The man seemed unable to move,
although his eyes continued to plead with Tilder as if to beg for
help.  Amber took all this in within a moment's time, and held her
hand out for Tilder to stay with the man.  "Time to take care of
some business--I'll be back!" she said to her halfling companion.
With Bell and Mort out of the way, Tilder guarding the paralyzed--by
fear or through some other means--man, Amber was free to concentrate
on one thing: the cold, hard steel of her blade.
<p>
Amber turned to the room, and saw the man--a priest, she surmised,
from his imposing stature and garb.  She also saw that he stood
almost motionless, eyes closed, not afraid of the danger he faced.
Behind her she felt someone approach, and in her periphery she saw
Xanter standing with sword drawn.
<p>
"Wait--" Amber spoke aloud to Xanter, who seemed eager to move past
her--to do what, he wasn't sure.  Her word attracted the attention of
one of the two mobile halfling-creatures.  A third rose from underneath
a white sheet at the far side of the room, and discarded the covering
with a flurry of waving hands.  "This is starting to look really
bad," Amber thought to herself.  Just then, she felt a warm sensation,
and she turned again to look at the priest, who'd reopened his eyes
and raised his arms.  His thumbs and forefingers he touched together
to make a circle in the air.
<p>
<font color="yellow">[Technically, this is round 3 of combat,
round 2 being spent outside (Amber, Xanter) and in the office (Tilder).
Initiative rolls: Xanter: 4, Tilder: 7, Priest 8, Ghouls + Amber: 9]</font>
<p>
Stepping past Amber despite her objections, Xanter felt
compelled to send the undead halfling in front of them--another of
his friends--away from the torment of undeath, and to the peace of
death.  Perhaps he wasn't truly convinced his actions were the right
ones, as his blade's arc drifted shy of his target who lumbered out
of the way.  <font color="yellow">[Xanter needs 13, rolls 6 +2 (magic sword)
= 8.]</font>
<p>
From within the room, Tilder watched Xanter's attack.
He felt sorry for the strange halfling, whose name he did not
even know, and crouched defensively as if to ward off any invaders
into the office by sheer force of will.
<p>
Just then, the priest spoke in a low, almost rumbling voice:
<blockquote>
<font face="MS Sans Serif">
"You creatures who look very mean:<br>
At your hands we wish not to be creamed!<br>
In the name of The Light,<br>
I say, 'get out of my sight!'<br>
In essense, TAKE THAT YOU FIEND!"
</font>
</blockquote>
As if the undead halflings had defied the very rules of existence
itself--which in essence, was true--several of them instantly turned
to dust, including two of the three that had clearly awakened from
death.
<p>
<font color="yellow">[2d6=9 of them were destroyed.
The priest, 8th level, didn't even need a roll to turn these ghouls.]</font>
<p>
The remaining halfling-ghoul, the one that faced Amber,
desperately reached to claw at her as the she-elf swung her blade.
<p>
<font color="yellow">[Ghoulie needs a 21 to hit Amber in her magic elven chain,
rolls 17.  Amber again gets two attacks again, rolling 8 (swish), 10 (splat):
7 dmg.]</font>
<p>
Amber's first swing was off-target, perhaps because the halfling-ghoul
also swung at her with his rotting fingers as she made her lunge.
Undaunted, she twirled in a complete circle, letting the momentum
of her initial attack carry her into a
follow-up swipe.  With an elven cry to bolster her inner resolve, she
forced her blade deep into the flesh of her opponent, and her foe,
headless, toppled to the floor.
<p>
In the moments after the clash, the priest spoke up.
<font face="MS Sans Serif">"I do say, hello to you all!
Yikes, those guys won't be bothering
us anymore, heh!"</font>  He stepped over the decapitated ex-halfling
non-chalantly and held out his hands in greeting to Amber, who was
just beginning to calm down from her furious assault.
<font face="MS Sans Serif">"I'm Jolan Tru,"</font> he spoke,
apparently not threatened by the undead
halfling at her side.  He glanced past Amber and saw John walking
in behind her.  <font face="MS Sans Serif">"Is everyone alright?
I dare say we haven't much
time before the rest wake up, so if you'll excuse me...."</font>
<p>
<font face="MS Sans Serif">"I was giving them a tour when they just
started waking up!"</font> John offers in explanation.
<p>
Jolan nodded, then pulled out a silver rod and began to sprinkle
the remaining dead with water contained within it.  When he was done,
he uttered a few arcane words and spread his hands out over the
breadth of the room.
<p>

<h3 align=center>
<A NAME="13">13</A><br>
8/26/2000 - 8/31/2000
</h3>

<p>
<font color="orange">Xanter stayed close to Amber and tried to listen to what 
was going on, learning everything he could.</font>  He sheathed his sword,
crossed his arms and stood in a non-threatening manner.</p>
<p>
The priest's calm demeanor had a mellowing effect on Amber, and she 
felt more relaxed than she could ever recall after such an adrenaline 
rush. It never bothered her, much, to kill something or someone evil. It 
seemed instinct to her. People who had had no choice in the matter 
however.... She tried not to think about the person that was that undead 
creature at some point. She silently said a prayer to soothe her mind, while 
looking up expectantly. Given the number of dead, or undead, left in 
the room, she did not feel comfortable sheathing her sword just yet.</p>
<p>
After a quick look at Xanter to see how he was doing, given the spell that 
had just been cast, she turned to the priest. "Is what you're doing now 
going to neutralize these undead halflings, or should we be prepared 
for more?" she asked.</p>
<p>
Tilder emerged from his crouch, and turned to the frightened mortician.
"Are you OK?" he asked, sheathing his sword.  Seeing that he was still
paralyzed, he left him where he lay, and walked over to Amber and the
priest.</p>
<p>
As Tilder got up to leave, <font face="MS Sans Serif">"Uuhhhhnnn!"</font>
came the reply of the
paralyzed man, as if to say, "Don't leave me!" or maybe "you're stepping
on my foot!" Tilder wasn't sure, but had to check out the main room's action
nonetheless.</p>
<p>
As the priest finished his ministrations, Tilder regarded the "good" 
hobbit ghoul with a knot in his throat, and a forced smile for 
pleasantry's sake. If that was the afterlife, he wanted no part of it! It was
up to Finty, of course. And the only certainty about the fickle goddess 
was the uncertain outcome of her dice. She nevertheless had favored him 
today. He shuddered with thoughts of what might have been.</p>
<p>
Soon he humbly asked Jolan Tru for his help. "Mr. Tru, my name is 
Tilder. I think this guy," he pointed to the paralyzed man back in the office,
"needs your assistance, if you have time, sir."</p>
<p>
Then to Amber, Tilder remarked, "Pardon me, your ma---er, Amber, your 
most worthy and ably-wielded sword is dripping on my toes!"</p>
<p>
<font face="MS Sans Serif">"This should keep them dead, don't worry,
Miss."</font> Jolan finally offered to the
elven warrior.  Then, turning to Tilder, he put away his sprinkler and headed
toward the office.  <font face="MS Sans Serif">"Ah, let me go and help
him!"</font> Jolan sighed, overacting his
part with gestures and flamboyance. <font face="MS Sans Serif">"A priest's
work is never done....
Turning this, blessing that, healing this, rhyming that."</font>
He suddenly stopped,
and looked skyward. <font face="MS Sans Serif">"Of course, I love the work!
Don't get me wrong!"</font>
He looked back at Tilder and Amber, who were not amused, and sighed again.
He snickered, and went into the office.</p>
<p>
<font face="MS Sans Serif">"Well, now we know what went on with these guys.
Slain by ghouls."</font>
John turned to Xanter. <font face="MS Sans Serif">"You don't remember anything
else? If a score
of halfling rogues wasn't enough to repell this force, maybe we should be
on the lookout for trouble heading this way!"</font></p>
<p>
Amber looked at her sword, which indeed <em>was</em> dripping
halfling-ghoul blood. She pulled out a cloth and began to wipe it down,
nodding to Tilder in apology, and listening to what Xanter was about to say.</p>
<p>
Xanter was staring at Jolan, or his back, anyway, as the priest knelt
to tend to the injured man in the office. "Ghouls. The Great Light." Xanter
shut his eyes, then opened them suddenly. "I, I remember!  *cough*
We had just met up with a priest of the Ikran order from Khadyr. We had
camped next to the Furter.... Yes, that's it." Xanter spoke more quickly now.
"Onearm and a few of us had been talking with the priest at our campfire,
when, when...." Xanter seemd unable to continue, traumatized from
the memory. "*cough* We head this awful scream--one of our perimeter scouts,
it turned out, so of course we all rushed to arms. The campfire was put out,
and people were dying all around me. When we finally figured out who it
was among us, our number was already reduced by half. The creatures
attacked with purpose, with deadly force. I met *cough* up with the priest
for a moment in the chaos and saw determination, maybe concentration,
in his eyes. I remember thinking, 'why isn't he running, fighting?'
The last thing I remember is an awful pain." Xanter looked down at his belly,
and realized he was still kind of in bad shape.</p>
<p>
Just then, the Constible barged in the back entrance, sword in hand, with Bell
right behind him.</p>
<p>
Surprised that he so eloquently related the story of his own 
doom as he did, Xanter felt somewhat proud of myself. Even as a dead halfling
he still had some brains working somewhere. "Does that information help?" 
he asked, directing his question at no one in particular.</p>
<p>
"At least I was glad I didn't want to kill anyone and eat their brains," he
silently mused."</p>
<p>
"Hi Xanter, I'm Tilder. I've met a few of your band before. They were a 
right respectable bunch of halflings," Tilder fibbed, making small talk. 
Of course his only run-in with Onearm's band was when he was with the 
Orc gang Ounze!, and they'd robbed the poor sots. That had been about 
the time he'd started getting fed up with the dastardly orcs, who were 
always getting him to do their dirty work.</p>
<p>
Seemed like Onearm's band was again being targeted, and this time, with 
dire and horrible consequences. Tilder suggested to the group, "Looks 
like Two Rivers' Forge better arm itself, just in case the ghouls come 
this way."</p>
<p>
"Thanks Tilder," Xanter replied.  "I don't know what to say. I'm kind of out of 
my element. Its almost as if someone thwapped me on the head and I woke 
up the next day remembering only bits and pieces of my past life." He
wasn't very good at small talk and it showed. Plus, he was a very ugly 
halfling when I was alive, and being dead didn't help any with his
personality.</p>
<p>
Amber admired the way her blade gleamed in the sunlight.  The reflection 
from outside the morgue of the trees and the sky danced as she turned it to
wipe the other side.
She had never used her sword in any questionable manner, and she
was proud of that. But something about killing those undead halflings 
was bothering her... but no time to think about it now.  She sized up the
situation, putting off the Constible's entry for a moment.  There was one half
undead halfling--did that make him a quarterling?--who had some
answers to all of this. Maybe further discussions with him would shed 
some light on why this was bothering her so much.</p>
<p>
"Hello again, Xanter," she said.  With that, she buried her discomfort deep 
and reached out to shake his hand. "Hopefully this time we won't get 
interrupted by screams, eh?"</p>
<p>
"Hi Amber," Tilder said, bowing slightly then shaking her hand. Even dead he 
still had manners. "Yeah, with Constable here we are really safe right?" 
I smirk slightly.</p>
<p>
<font face="MS Sans Serif">"Hm, nice blade, uh, Amber, was it? I came as
fast I could."</font>
The Constable huffed and puffed as if he were getting too old for the sort
of thing he had run into at the morgue that day. The officer of the law
regarded the hodge-podge collection of adventurers with raised eyebrows and
waited for an explanation, as obviously he had missed the action.  Behind him,
Bell looked a bit sheepish and did not readily walk past his boss into the
room with the not-so-dead folks. <font face="MS Sans Serif">"Well? I ran all
the way down here
and almost split my britches in the process. What the heck went down
here?"</font>
he finished, noticing more than one decapitated body on the floor as well as
some piles of armor and weapons, and dust.</p>
<p>
<font face="MS Sans Serif">"Good as new! Ah, hi Constable!"</font> Jolan spoke,
brushing his hands together, and emerging from the office.</p>
<p>
The Constable waited for an answer, and John, Bell and Jolan deferred the
explanation to the newcomers.</p>
<p>
As Xanter stood there with new associates, he wondered what would happen to 
him.  "What real life could I have being dead and why was I not a brainless 
zombie?  And just how long would my new friends really want to hang 
around a dead halfling?" Those were just a few of the questions he considered
as Tilder explained to the Constable what had happened.
</p><p>
<!-- 345 -->
Before the Constable could say anything, Amber felt like she should 
jump in.
 "If these people couldn't tell that the halflings were undead and 
about to wake up and eat everyone's brains, then did she really want to 
hear _their_ suggestions on the matter?
</p><p>
"I think we should make sure that the ones in there have been taken 
care of. Then, we need to research some priests in the area to join our 
band and go find this undead army. Then, we need to go and neutralize 
them. And maybe, in the process, we need to find out where this all began! 
Anyone else have a good idea?"  Tilder's explanation of the events was a good
starting point, but she took it upon her self to set the next actions in
motion.
</p><p>
<!-- 347 -->
Tilder pulled Amber aside. "Uh, Amber, I don't want to sound like a 
party-pooper, but what about Gnash? Shouldn't we stick around Two Rivers' 
so we can meet up again? And besides, shouldn't we really be 
concentrating on our quest?"</p>
<p>
<!-- 349 -->
Amber was offended. As if she had forgotten their quest? As if she 
would have forgotten her best friend? "He doesn't know you very well, 
Amber," she told herself, as she tried to clean the irritation from her 
voice.</p>
<p>
"Gnash may not be here for another day or two. One or two days spent 
trying to save lives will not be wasted, and the quest will remain 
present, for us to continue. If in two days we cannot find what we seek, then 
we shall at least feel that we have done the most we could, at present, 
and resolve to continue the search at a later date. In the meantime, 
after two days recon, my courier will have brought back help for Two 
Rivers' Forge. They can take over at that time, provided we have not 
rectified the problem."</p>
<p>
"If Gnash does arrive early, he will ask where we are, if we have 
arrived, and then he will be told that we took a short trip and will be 
back within two days." she said to Tilder, in hushed tones. "Besides, the 
quest isn't a concern for the sake of the quest; it is a concern 
because there are people, my people as well as others, dying. We would do 
well to remember that." She paused, looking for Tilder's reaction. 
"Tilder," she continued, "you are welcome to stay behind and wait for Gnash if 
that makes you feel more comfortable." And with that, she walked away. 
She needed to think, and to send for the Two Rivers Forge Royal Courier.</p>
<p>
<!-- 350 -->
After Tilder and Amber had their words, but before Amber could
leave the scene, the Constable spoke up, having removed his face covering
and sheathing his dagger. <font face="MS Sans Serif">"Okay. First things first!
Looks like we have some dead halflings to bury. Jolan, you'll see to
that."</font></p>
<p>
<font face="MS Sans Serif">"Of course."</font>  Jolan scratched his chin.
<font face="MS Sans Serif">"We should also consider
trying to contact Onearm's clan, to let them know about the dead we found,
and also about Xanter."</font> Jolan turned to Amber.
<font face="MS Sans Serif">"Don't worry. These
halflings are tucked safely away in the covers of death. And as far as
researching priests is concerned, why spend all day at the library when you
have moi?"</font>  With that, he flourished his robes and bowed elegantly.</p>
<p>
It occurred to Xanter that generally, one doesn't find Onearm.
Rather, Onearm does the finding. "Ah, it'll probably be difficult to find
us--them," Xanter offered. "After all, we are a band of rogues who for the
most part stay out of most everybody's way."</p>
<p>
<font color="yellow">[[DM: Xanter starts to feel more anguish at the grizzly
sight of your dead companions, some of which are now merely piles of
waterlogged clothes and armor under white sheets...]]</font></p>
<p>
Straightening, the priest turned to the Onearm clan survivor.
<font face="MS Sans Serif">"Xanter, if you don't mind, I'd like to speak with
you about your, shall I say, unique condition. You are as much a mystery
to me as the black nymphs have been to the generations."</font> Just then,
the formerly paralyzed mortician walked out of the room, holding his head as
if to keep it together.  <font face="MS Sans Serif">"I told you to stay seated!
Ah. Can't have enough patience when it comes to
patients, my mother always used to say."</font></p>
<p>
<font face="MS Sans Serif">"Ok then. I think,"</font> he said, speaking over his
shoulder to Bell, who had also removed his face cover,
<font face="MS Sans Serif">"we have a rumor to dispell. I don't mean to delay
you much longer, Amber,"</font> the Constable offered,
noticing Amber was itching to head out, <font face="MS Sans Serif">"but I
wanted to say thank you.  To both of you,"</font> he said to Amber and Tilder.
<font face="MS Sans Serif">"Thanks for helping us with our little
'plague.'"</font></p>
<p>
<font face="MS Sans Serif">"Yes indeed! Without your presence here, I'm afraid
John and Mort would have been killed!"</font> He sighed and said mostly to
himself, <font face="MS Sans Serif">"I certainly
wasn't much help!"</font> Bell seems a bit embarrassed at his weak stomach for
dreadful (and "undread"ful) surprises.</p>
<p>
With that, Amber led the entourage out of the morgue. Bell and the Constable
also turned to go. Outside, the humans' voices were overheard talking with
John and the recently revived Mort, who were giving the officer of the law
their own perspective on what had happened that day at The End.</p>
<p>
<font color="yellow">[[DM: By the way, Amber, you feel intrigued by Xanter's
situation, and impressed with his respect, almost as if he knows about your 
royal lineage, which seems far-fetched considering you've not spent much
time in the territory his clan apparently claimed as it's stomping ground.
Namely, that of north Trassgar, far north of Furterville, and west of 
Khadyr.]]</p>
<p>
What do you all do? Tilder, will you stay in Two Rivers' Forge
and wait for Gnash to catch up with you? Will you join Amber and Jolan in
heading northeast up the Furter River to find Onearm's clan? What do you think
of Xanter? Xanter, do you talk with Jolan? Do you try to tag along with Tilder
and Amber?]]</font></p>
