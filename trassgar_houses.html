The Third House occupies the North Central Region of Trassgar; it borders the Black Forrest and Blue River to the South, the Fifth House to the East and the Sixth House to the West.  To the North is the Great Expanse.<p>

The Third House is the Ruling House of the Trassgarian High Family.  Malakah rules with his wife, Epsia, at his side, and his children, Amber, Kara, Lilkahg, Mara, Jakasa, Midgark.  Most of the family and close relatives have moved into hiding to escape the assassination brigades of Klaxton Kurl.  This move was made after the unfortunate demise of the leaders of the Sixth House and the assassination of Malakah's eldest son, Lem.  Though in hiding, they still manage the affairs of the realm, and mobilize a resistance army to push Kurl's evil minions out of North Trassgar.<p>

<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua"><B><P>Lemkule the Meek</B>, He-Elf of the First House of Trassgar</P>
<U><b><P>lineage</P></b></U></FONT>
<P>
Members of the First House are not directly descended from the Ruling Family, but are given honorary lineage that goes back to Furji, son of Furlong the Wise and Gyter the Strong. All members of the First House are Priests and Healers, and must go through long years of ordination and testing to prove their dedication to both the order's directives and the Third House.</P>
<P>The leader of the First House is currently Lemkule the Meek. He was appointed by Gyrus the Weak, appointed by Stameck the Old, appointed by Krilm the Young, appointed by Krypus the Strong, appointed by Furji the Tender, son of Furlong the Wise and Gyter the Strong.</P>

<P>Lemkule has no love for Klaxton Kurl, and has made a bold stand against him, not because he has a political agenda but because his heart is for the people, and his order will stand for the benefit of the people. He and his priests and healers go into the communities ministering to their spiritual and physical needs as best they can. Kurl and his henchmen have done much damage that has fostered great need among the people of Trassgar, so Lemkule and his order are tired, and remain busier than they have ever been.</P>

<U><b><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua"><P>leadership history</P>
</b></U></FONT><P>The Fourth House of Trassgar is headed by Yahdir the Wistful, an old man content to hunt wild dwarf dogs and snare elusive krimtree racknahs as long as peace rests on the land. He is subject to his relation, Malakah, He-Elf of the Third House of Trassgar, ruler of all the North Elfdom.</P>

<U><b><P>lineage</P>
</b></U></FONT><P>husband of Krishpah, daughter of Preussik, firstborn son of Grismond, firstborn son of Jakir, firstborn son of Lem, son of Furlong the Wise and Gyter the Strong.</P>
<U><b><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua"><P>lands</P>
</b></U></FONT><P>The Fifth House of Trassgar is located on the East Coast of Trassgar, bordering the Kalorian Sea to the East, the Black Forrest to the West, the Fourth House of Trassgar to the North, and the Cyskerine Desert to the South.</P>
<U><b><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua"><P>leadership history</P>
</b></U></FONT><P>The Fifth House of Trassgar is headed by Krimlak the Violent, a middle-aged man beckoned by the call of the sea and the lure of treasure. He comes from a long line of talented thieves, yet feels a great responsibility to lead his people. He wooed and married a lovely vixen of a she-elf, who he met in the Cock and Bottle Tavern in Forest's Edge. They had many adventures together, stealing treasure and money from then Baron Klaxton Kurl of the Southern region. When they married, he and his wife, Krishpah, became heirs to the throne of the Fifth House. Krishpah's parents were killed in an assassination by Kurl's henchmen, and ever since Krimlak has dealt with anyone wearing a black sash or known to be associated with Kurl in a bloody, painful manner. He and his family and legions are well-trained, and have refused to go into hiding with the rest of the ruling families. Theirs is the greatest stronghold of military might in Trassgar, and even Kurl cannot penetrate deeply into the Fifth House.</P>

<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua"><B><P>Jankira the Bold, </B>She-Elf of the Sixth House of Trassgar</P>
<U><b><P>lineage</P>
</b></U></FONT><P>second-born daughter of Yhillaf, firstborn son of Lakfah, firstborn son of Dahnahr, firstborn son of Grem, firstborn son of Kalar, secondborn daughter of Igrem, son of Furlong the Wise and Gyter the Strong.</P>
<U><b><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua"><P>lands</P>
</b></U></FONT><P>The lands of the Sixth House lie West of the Third House, North of the Lanagg River, extending North the Great Expanse and West to Ice City and a little beyond.</P>
<U><b><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua"><P>leadership history</P>
</b></U></FONT><P>Jankira is the youngest head of a ruling family. Only ninety years in age, she has little leadership experience and is not yet married. However, what she lacks in experience she makes up for in courage and strength. The throne of the Sixth House was thrust upon her through the tragic death of her parents and elder siblings in a boating accident while sailing off the East Coast of the Fifth House, while visiting distant relatives. The boat was never recovered, and Kurl's assassination brigades are largely believed to be responsible. However, since the boat was never recovered, there is no evidence of assassination. Jankira now leads her House and peoples from hiding in order to raise and protect her younger siblings: Jinkal, Samira, and Igrem. </P>

<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua"><B><P>Jakal the Foolish</B>, She-Elf of the Seventh House of Trassgar</P>
<U><b><P>lineage</P>
</b></U></FONT><P>firstborn daughter of Khdarik, firstborn son of Kildar, firstborn son of Limbak, firstborn son of Tamir, daughter of Lem, son of Furlong the Wise and Gyter the Strong.</P>
<U><b><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua"><P>lands</P>
</b></U></FONT><P>The Black Forrest</P>
<U><b><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua"><P>leadership history</P>
</b></U></FONT><P>Jakal's lands have been taken by Baron Klaxton Kurl of the Southern Region. Originally, they were the hunting, scouting, and playing grounds of Lem the Ranger, but under Jakal's leadership the Legion of Rangers grew lax and the forest was infiltrated and the rangers subdued. It is rumored that the Rangers are being held captive somewhere in the forest. As for Jakal, she has disappeared and is feared dead. However, since no proof of her death can be found and her lands are under the power of another, no successor has been named. Jakal's children have found safe haven with the Third House, with the exception of Garglex, who is rumored to have aided Kurl in his military offensive.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>(the second house of Trassgar is not mentioned or acknowledged anymore. To mention it is blasphemous, and can ignite tempers and cause one's life to end (ulp!). the second house was wiped out, every elf, for treasonous acts against Trassgar.)</P>
