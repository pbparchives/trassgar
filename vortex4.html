<P>Amber began canvassing their surroundings more closely than before,
if that were possible, for the easiest way out. She didn't like being misled,
and she certainly couldn't trust the people in the room with them.
If they would omit such pertinent information once, she thought,
and silently wondered how much strength she would have to put behind her
swing to incapacitate (or decapitate) their adversaries
should the need arise. Her attention was drawn back to their hosts as the
Constable voiced concern that this was no ordinary plague.

<P><font face="MS Sans Serif">"I've never seen anything like it,"</font>
he said, worry lines creasing his forehead.
<font face="MS Sans Serif">"The bodies look as if something otherworldly may
have happened to them, yet the vast numbers we're finding make us question
that theory."</font>

<P>"Have you seen one of the victims alive, still in the throes of the
whatever-it-is?" Tilder asked, beginning to feel an increased sense of his
self-preservation instincts, which always seemed to make him
think more clearly.

<P><font face="MS Sans Serif">"No, no we haven't. The only ones we've
found have been fished out of the river, and obviously they
were already dead,"</font> Bell replied.

<P>"We'll need to see the bodies," Amber said matter-of-factly.

<P><font face="MS Sans Serif">"See them?"</font> the Constable asked,
looking unsure.

<P>"Yes, see them. We can't very well deduce what is going on without
having all of the empirical evidence." She could hear the irritation
in her tone of voice. The last thing she needed was for her
royal impertinence to show through. That's what her father always called
it---impertinence: <EM>Amber, you can't have your subjects thinking that
you are annoyed with them, or bored with them. They trust you, trust us,
and they must feel that we are concerned with even the most minute of
their problems.  And not only must they feel that way, but it should BE
that way.</EM>  Quickly she thought a meditation,
and wiped the irritation from her mind and voice, and noticed Bell
nodding to the Constable, as if giving assent to her request.

<P>"And, if possible, we'll want to talk to the people who have been
fishing the bodies out of the river, and see if anyone has noticed
anything unusual that they may have though insignificant before.
And then, maybe after dinner, we should look at the places you're finding
the bodies, and talk to your scouts. That should give us enough information
to decide what our next move should be. Any additional thoughts, Tilder?"

<P>Tilder shook his head slightly.  <EM>Something is bothering him,</EM>
Amber thought, <EM>something other than this so-called plague.</EM>

<P>"Not yet," he replied, "Though we probably should secure lodging for the
night while we are out and about."  Amber nodded in assent, and they
followed Bell Prathem out the door to view the bodies.

<P>It was a beautiful afternoon. The sun shone brightly, and the first
spring flowers were just beginning to show their color.  Amalthea used to
remark that the little silvertoes that bloomed at the beginning of
Spring gleamed with the reflection of the sunrays.  <EM>Like a little
piece of the heavens!</EM> he had once heard her exclaim to the forest.
The Black Forest, Tilder recalled darkly, amid a transient wash of sickness.

<P>As they neared the river, they began to move through a marsh.
The rattle reeds grew thick, and he was glad for the well-beaten path.
Above the marsh was a plateau, and soon they passed a house with some
silvertoes in the front meadow.  Suddenly, the pouch at Tilder's belt
bobbed heavily, slapping hard against his hip as he stepped over a
bleached rock, and he became very aware that he had no home to
call his own, no bed that was "his."  He felt uneasy.

<P>And something else was wrong.  His eyes scanned the horizon,
but found nothing save a few twittering birds and wind-tossed leaves.
He knew that Amber was on her guard.  He had been around her long enough
to know when she felt on the defensive---her walk was tighter, more measured.
Even still, she didn't seem to convey anything beyond the mistrust of their
hosts, which she had whispered to him earlier.  No matter how he tried to
ignore it, he could feel that something wasn't right here.

<P>Perhaps he was projecting his own fears of what they would find onto the
otherwise placid scene.  <EM>I've never seen a dead halfling before.</EM>
He was startled by the random thought that seemed to have escaped from its
cursed cell in his soul---his own Two Rivers' Forge, crouching malignantly,
waiting patiently for inevitable liberation from two years of quarantine.
A grisly image of what could have been, what certainly <EM>should</EM>
have been, flashed ethereally before him.

<P>He felt ill.

<P>Amber happened to glance at Tilder, and thought she saw a look of
horror on his face.  When she looked again, however, he looked fine,
if a bit pale and distant.  It was worth checking.  She dropped back a
little bit from their hosts, walking close to him as they cleared a
small thicket of brambles and bog.  "Tilder?"  <EM>Oh, not again!</EM>

<P>Tilder's demons held his mind captive as they replayed history.
As each flashback approached the nexus point, that dreaded instant which
changed his life forever, Tilder felt his participation waning; he became
more disconnected from the horrible drama, as if he had tried to write himself
out of the script he was being forced to review.  His thoughts,
whatever they had been, were lost, and all that remained to his character
were his actions.

<HR WIDTH="50%">

<P>Amalthea greeted Tilder upon his return to the secreted covey of THoR
elves.  "Well?" she asked hesitantly, since his moonlit expression betrayed
neither success nor failure.  Ellendale and Rowend in concert craned their
necks.

<P>"I uh, well... I got it!" he instantly beamed pure joy.  Withdrawing the
twice-pilfered gem from a pocket, he dropped it into Amalthea's outstretched
hand.  He basked in the elves' smiles.

<P>"A heavy little rock!" Amalthea exclaimed softly, hefting the green stone.
"I had no doubt you would succeed, Tilder," she remarked confidently.

<P>"Thank you, 'Thea."

<P>It was Rowend's turn to peer at Tilder's prize.  "We should return
it to the monastery's brazier," he said flatly, looking with visible hatred
downhill in the direction of the noisy sashers' camp.

<P>"Oh cheer up, lover.  What use now have the poor monks of worldly
possessions?  The monastery is in ruins!  I say let him keep it,"
Ellendale gently chastised.  "Our little thief has finally earned his
niche in THoR."  The illusionist winked at Tilder.  "Here you go.
You earned it!"  She saluted with the gem, and passed it back.

<P>"Well, thanks Elly, but I..."

<P>Rowend softened as Tilder stammered.  The stress of the day's tragedy
had worn his temper thin, but he was nevertheless proud of Amalthea's recruit.
Given the racial tensions of the times, any other Third House Ranger wouldn't
have flinched to kill a halfling thief caught in the act.  But not good
Amalthea.  That was at least a year ago, and he had slowly come to see the
logic behind her dubious choice.  He added his blessing as he returned the
stone to Amalthea, "May you not forget this day for as long as you keep this."
Raising an elven brow, he jested, "And hopefully that will last beyond our
next furlough."

<P>"I, uh, thanks Row, ..., but um...."

<P>Only Amalthea realized Tilder had more to say, and pressing the exquisitely
cut gemstone into his knobby hands, she encouraged him, "Is there more?"

<P>Collective silence.  Even the orcs' din seemed to decrease.  Then
Tilder nodded and voiced meekly, "I heard where they are keeping the Rangers."

<P>Tilder jumped at the three elves' transformation.  Rowend jerked to his
feet, Ellendale had a most un-elvish expression on her face, and Tilder's
words had struck Amalthea's slight frame like a battering ram.  Catching
the excitement he blurted, "One of the sashers just left downhill for it,
but we don't have to track him.  I have the directions!"  He tapped his left
temple.

<P>"By the light of Lothlorien!" Amalthea uttered simultaneously with
Ellendale's gasp, "The Rangers of the Seventh!" and Rowend's "Thhhh!"
Their elven leader looked down through the trees toward the distant orcs'
flickering, crackling fire.  It was so quiet that they could hear the
mul-pine sap popping, echoing through the woods.  "Thought I heard something;
guess not."

<P>Rowend shifted his attention and sized up the thief.
Rowend had sensed that Amalthea possessed the keenest ability to judge
character, but he had never fully trusted her vision until now.
He approached the halfling and knelt to his level.  "Tilder, up to this point,
we have known you only by that single name.  You now have earned a second."
He glanced through the moonbeams toward the she-elves.  "What shall it be you
two?"

<P>Ellendale contributed, "Well, I did urge him to walk with a whisper."

<P>"That was truly poetic, mate.  How about 'Whisper'... ummm,
'Whisper'-something," Rowend struggled.

<P>"<EM>Whisperfoot,</EM>" Amalthea spoke solemnly.

<P>The other elves agreed.  Rowend readdressed him, "Tilder,
when we return with this news, the elves of the Third House will come to know
you as 'Whisperfoot.'  Well done, my friend."

<P>Amalthea hugged the astonished halfling.  "Well done... Whisperfoot."

<HR WIDTH="50%">

<P>"<EM>Whisperfoot!</EM>" Amber tapped Tilder's arm with her scabbard as they
progressed through the marsh, "What's wrong? Are you feeling alright?"
She noticed he was gripping a belt pouch so tightly that his knuckles
gleamed white through halos of ruddy hair.  He shuddered, and was that a
tear he was struggling to erase?

<P>"M'Lady, I am so---sorry," Tilder murmured between shivers.

<P><font face="MS Sans Serif">"What was that?"</font> Bell Prathem boomed,
turning as they reached a clearing.  <font face="MS Sans Serif">"Oh, nevermind.
We're here."</font>

<A NAME="11">11</A><br>
8/2/2000 - 8/22/2000
</h3>
</p>
   <font color="orange">
   Amber and Tilder approached the Two Rivers'
   Forge morgue with Bell Pratham in the lead.</font>
   Atop a small rise in the land overlooking the
   valley to the east, Bell showed them where the
   river ran west into the town to give them an
   idea of where they'd pulled the bodies out of
   the water.
<p>
   The morgue was more than just a place to put
   dead folks. They didn't get a lot of dead
   people, Bell explained, so the morgue would just
   sit there empty all day if they didn't find
   some other functions for it. As a result,
   they had constructed a nice, respectable
   mortuary on the ground level where they could
   hold funeral services, and in the tradition
   of the town, a small forge had been installed
   in a back room to carry out cremations.
<p>
   <font face="MS Sans Serif">"The morgue is actually under ground, where
   it's cooler,"</font> Bell explained.
<p>
   "Makes sense," Amber thought to herself.
<p>
   <font face="MS Sans Serif">"There's an entrance to the lower level from
   around back, where the hill slopes down toward
   the river valley. In this case, it was real
   convenient to have the morgue so close to
   the river,"</font> Bell continued as Tilder nodded
   and glanced around nerviously.
<p>
   "You say you want to get to the bottom of this,"
   Bell spoke, looking at the she-elf. "That's
   real good of you. Anything you can figure out
   would be a great help to this town and it's
   collective peace of mind."
<p>
   Tilder noticed that around back and down the
   hill, a robed figured was squeezing out some
   wet cloth onto the grass. He also noticed that
   the person didn't have a mask on his face.
<p>* * *<br>
   Bucking up his courage, Tilder maneuvered around the
   corner of the building to get a closer look at the robed
   figure. "So who is that down there?
   Why does he wear no face cover?" Tilder asked Bell. 
<p>* * *<br>
   <font face="MS Sans Serif">"Well, let's go ask him,"</font>
   Bell replied. Amber gave Tilder a smirk, recalling
   his fear and noticing again the resulting tightly wrapped decor about him.
<p>
   Bell led the travelers around to the east side of the building. The grassy
   hill sloped downward to a down-trodden area and soon the three came nearer
   to the man they noticed had no face cover. A curious smell wafted in the
   air before them, no doubt pushed along by the breeze off the churning river.
   Two other men came into view around the backside of the building, which was
   now plainly seen as a multi-level structure, with a back entrance into the
   building set into the hillside.
<p>
   As the three approached, the man put down a crumple of cloth into a low-lying
   wicker half-basket that had some other cloth in it already.
   <font face="MS Sans Serif">"H'lo, Bell,"</font>
   the man spoke, as his visitors approached.
   <font face="MS Sans Serif">"Smell's thinning out some, in
   case you didn't know with all that on your face."</font>
<p>
   Bell replied familiarly, <font face="MS Sans Serif">"Smell or no smell,
   like I told you it seems best
   to be safe than sorry."</font> Bell adjusted his face cloth a bit,
   and spread an arm
   out, indicating Tilder and Amber. <font face="MS Sans Serif">"This is John,
   works here at the End. John,
   this here's Amber and her traveling companion, Tilder."</font>
   He pronounced <font face="MS Sans Serif">'Tilder'</font>
   slowly, as if it betrayed something.
<p>
   Amber nodded slightly in greeting, and Tilder spoke up,
   repeating his question
   about face covering. John replied somberly,
   <font face="MS Sans Serif">"Well, we can't rule out plague,
   and as a result some folks think its best to be safe than sorry, just in case
   there is something airborne lifted off the, er..."</font> He paused, noticing
   for the first time Tilder's features which identified him as a halfling, the
   same race as the dead from the river.
<p>
   Bell showed his surprise,
   <font face="MS Sans Serif">"I thought you were pretty sure...."</font>
<p>
   John interrupted.
   <font face="MS Sans Serif">"I know I told the constible what we suspect,
   but remember
   it was him that got on the bandwagon and got the townies all scared. I'm
   not so convinced of this plague theory anymore. But feel free to keep your
   face covered just in case I'm wrong."</font> He picked up his basket with
   both hands and turned toward the lower back entrance.
<p>
   <font face="MS Sans Serif">"They have offered to help if they can."</font>
<p>
   John considered Bell's news and paused.
   <font face="MS Sans Serif">"Tilder, we don't get many
   halflings visiting the Forge. I expect, you of all folks is just as curious
   about all this as Bell thought you might be. If'n you wanna help, best place
   to start might be the dead themselves."</font> He turned to look at the back
   entrance, the threshhold to the morgue.
   <font face="MS Sans Serif">"Of course, the morgue isn't in the
   usual visitor tour, but I'll show you around if you want."</font>
<p>* * *<br>

When John expressed doubts about the plague, Tilder's nervousness diminished, but he still kept Olen's blanket wrapped tightly around his body.
   The humans seemed to be keeping something from him, or they would not tread their words so heavily when they spoke to him.
<P>
   He did not much relish the thought of viewing a dead halfling up close, but by Finty's dice, he was going to figure out this mystery. He owed it to
   his unfortunate halfling kin, and besides, it kept his mind off nastier thoughts, like cursed mountain strongholds and orc sashers....
<P>
   He answered John, "And by your looks, John, I surmise I'm not your usual visitor. Yes, I for one am curious to see the bodies. Thanks for the
   offer." He cocked his shrouded head Amber's way, seeking her agreement. 
<P>* * *<br>
Amber nodded her agreement. She wanted to figure out exactly what these bodies looked like, see the evidence first hand. Too many times ignorant
   people missed key observations, and therefore missed the truth. No chances needed to be taken with this. For the first time, she considered
   contacting the nearest royal courier and sending a message to the castle. "After I see the evidence," she thought. "Then, if need be, I'll send for
   Titus." But even as she made the decision, she cringed inwardly. 
<p>
   As they made their way to the morgue, the blanket Tilder held tight to his body was giving Amber the creeps. She shivered, and braced herself for
   seeing one of the faces of death. 
<p>* * *<br>
   John led his visitors to the back entrance. He nodded in passing to
   two humans who were cleaning up the well-worn dirt in front of the back
   entrance. Above the wooden frame that bored into the hillside was neatly
   nailed a board with calm print that read, "The End." The four passed under
   the archway and into the alcove leading to the back door. The door stood
   open, and the four walked through it. Tilder noticed the door was propped
   open with a heavy rock, and it occurred to him that it was a temporary door
   stop. After all, who would want to leave the door to a morgue open? John
   paused just inside to usher the human, elf and halfling into the room, and
   noticed Tilder's interest in the doorstop.
<p>
   The mortician spoke up to explain.
   <font face="MS Sans Serif">"Yeah, we're losin' our cool
   underground air, but we propped it open cause the door is so heavy, and
   we've had an unusual amount of traffic through it recently."</font>
<p>
   "How much traffic, exactly?" Amber wanted an update on the twenty
   that Bell quoted them at the sign posted outside the city.
<p>
   <font face="MS Sans Serif">"Twenty-one. The last one we dragged inside
   just before you folks walked up.
   Our signal tower up river hasn't signalled any more coming our way,
   so we figured this is the lot of them."</font>
<p>
   "Hence the cleanup," Amber thought to herself, nodding and
   remembering the rinsing of cloths outside.
<p>
   The <a href="graphics/2rf_morgue.jpg">room</a> was circular,
   with a stone floor and stone walls. From their
   viewpoint, the eastern-most side of the room, they could see the room as it
   was lit by lanterns atop posts in the room. An alcove branched off from the
   northeast corner of the room, and a door was set into a the wall immediately
   to the south of their position at the entry way. There were tables, cabinets
   and, most noticeably, still shapes covered with white sheets, lying silently
   atop slabs of stone on waist-high platforms that jutted out from the walls.
   A human, face masked, was attending to one of the bodies, just finishing his
   placement of a sheet over the person's head.
   <p>
<p>* * *<br>
Not giving his fears time to convince his muscles to do otherwise, Tilder walked in silently, and approached the masked human. The stone floor
   was cold on his bare feet.
<p>
   "Excuse me, my name is Tilder, and this is my companion Amber. We're here to help figure out all this," he gestured with a short arm-sweep, as
   much as his swaddling blanket would allow. "John says there is a, uh, recent arrival. Is it possible to," he paused to swallow what felt like a large
   frog, "see him, er, the body?" 
<p>* * *<br>
Amber surveyed the room. Nothing special. The smell wasn't that great. She was glad that Tilder was doing most of the talking--she felt more like
   being an observer in this situation. 
<p>* * *<br>
   The masked man tending to the dead looked first at Tilder, then Amber, then John and Bell. He raised his eyebrow.
<p>
   <font face="MS Sans Serif">"It's ok. Constible says they're ok to look,
   maybe they can help."</font>
<p>
   <font face="MS Sans Serif">"Alright then, Tilder,"</font>
   he acknowledged Tilder.  <font face="MS Sans Serif">"Ma'am,"</font>
   acknowledging Amber.
   <font face="MS Sans Serif">"This one's the last one we got, but they all
   look pretty much the same."</font> He lifted the white sheet covering
   one of the bodies, and uncovered a gruesome site.
   The short form that lay there was
   dressed in water-logged leather armor that was ripped in several places. His morbid features (rigidity, paleness) were combined with an unnatural
   bloating from being in the water for an extended period of time, in addition to a discoloration in streaks of dark purple. In his left hand was gripped
   the handle of a dagger, the blade of which was cracked off at the hilt.
<p>
   Amber looked at the body with somberness and curiosity. Bell's eyes even widened as he failed to comprehend the cause of death. John watched
   their reactions. After a minute or two of silence, the mortician started to put the sheet back over the body. Before he could cover up the head,
   Tilder's eyes suddenly widened.
<p>
   "Wait!" he spoke loudly, startling everyone in the morgue. He pointed to the dead halfling's head. Wrapped around it, barely visible
   underneat the toussle of brown, matted hair, was a leather strap. The mortician, who had gloved hands, volunteered to push the hair back to see the
   strap. It was an ordinary strap of leather, but it was etched with a black symbol.
<p>
   "What is it, Tilder?" On one part of the strap, Amber could see an engraving. "Do you recognize it?"
<p>
   "Yes." Tilder seemed unable to go on. They all looked closely. Burnt into the wet band was an icon of a right arm and hand, clutching a
   blade.
<p>
   In the silence, as they all looked to Tilder for an explanation, John spoke up. <font face="MS Sans Serif">"If I recall, they're all wearing them. The straps, that is."</font> John
   looked uneasy. The mortician looked at him; they both seemed surprised, as if neither of them had examined it before.
<p>
   Tilder finally managed to speak again, blurting out a name. "Onearm!" He took in a breath. "Syona Onearm. That's the symbol of his
   clan."
<p>
   Just then, a muted rustling of metal accompanied by a low moaning emanated from behind the closed office door. A startled gasp, a death-defying
   scream of terror, a crash of glass, and then the light which shone from underneath the closed door was snuffed. Bell and John looked at each other
   in shock, and the mortician suddenly wished he had taken the day off.
<p>* * *<br>
The strong odor of decaying flesh masked any hint of who, or what, the ruckus may have been caused by. Instinctively, Amber stepped backward
   so that a wall, and not a potential attacker, was at her rear. She knew that before the crash, Tilder had been on her right, so she twisted slightly to
   the left, to flank him.
<p>
   "Tilder?" Amber looked at her companion.
<p>* * *<br>
More to calm his own nerves, than to ward off any rolls of Finty's dice, Tilder spoke aloud, "Stay your steel, friends, it's probably nothing."
<p>
   The halfling was frightened more by the sudden movements and drawing of weapons than by the noises occurring beyond the office door. Amber's
   sword glinted in the torchlight as she lowered it, but only slightly.
<p>
   Tilder approached the door silently, listening for any more clues. 
<p>* * *<br>
In another corner of the room, there was movement.  But it went undetected...
for the moment.  Xanter looked around, but all he saw was a dark white.
He realized there was something covering his head, and raised his hands to
remove it. It was a sheet, and it was wet. In fact, he was wet.
Damp, and damp down to his bones. Strangely enough, he did not feel chilled.
He pulled the sheet off his head and surveyed the room.
<p>
A few paces away there were some people. One of them had flaming-red hair and
had just stepped backwards, her back mostly to him. Another
was short, his head with cloth. Three humans stood there with them.
All looked away from him toward a closed door, behind which noises of
moaning and clanging were periodically emanating. They seemed in a state of
surprise, having not quite decided what to do.
<p>
Xanter tried to remember what had happened to him, still unable,
or unwilling to speak to make his presence known. He looked at himself,
and saw that his light chain armor was ripped and torn. His hands were
scraped and cut, and his chest and belly, after a closer inspection,
had a nasty gouges in it. Yet, he felt no pain. He pieced it together,
and realized that he had been in a terrible battle.
Several other white sheets lay draped across
halflings--"they must be..." he thought sadly--on slabs in the same room.
The shock of his situation still hadn't hit home--namely, that he had died,
but now was conscious--when he heard another terrible crash.
<p>* * *<br>
Amber saw Tilder move toward the door. She didn't feel right;
something was amiss... What was that feeling? And then it hit her.
She felt like she was being watched. 
<p>* * *<br>
The thief approached the door with silent steps and attempted to listen at the door.
<p>
<font color="yellow">[[RI: (Rule Intrustion:) Needs &lt;= 30%, rolls 71%. Tilder either hears nothing, or nothing is there to be heard...]]</font>
<p>
   Hearing nothing, Tilder turned to his companions and shook his head. Then Tilder saw him. And heard him. Amber's feeling, as if she were being
   watched, was confirmed by Tilder's sight as he saw, and then heard, one of the corpses across the room speak.
<p>
"I'm, I'm not dead at least I don't think I am!" was his startled response to Tilder's curious and shocked glance.
<p>
   At this, human, elf, and halfling alike all jumped in alarm and whirled to face the previously-dead halfling, now sitting up and tossing a white sheet
   on the floor. John gulped, and the other mortician fainted, hitting the floor with a morbid-sounding thud. Bell grimaced, mortified, and joined the
   mortician in shocked slumber on the floor.
<p>
<font color="yellow">[[RI: Bell rolled an 18, the nameless mortician rolled a 12. Both fainted, failing their CON checks. John stomached the news with a roll of 8, Tilder
   rolled a 7, and Amber rolled a 9. I just sort of made up that CON check rule, seemed to fit the situation at seeing a slightly decayed, talking corpse.
   Hey, I'm the_almightydm, I can make up any rule I want!]]</font>
<p>
   Just then, the wooden door to the office burst open, knocking Tilder
<font color="yellow">[[RI: who rolled a natural 20, failing his DEX check to get out of the
   way--poor unlucky guy has a bad habit of that (see the battle with the kech in an earelier Vortex installment!)]]</font> aside and sending him tumbling into
   the entryway to the morgue, where he regained his feet
<font color="yellow">[[RI: Tumbling roll (DEX 0): 9. Yea!]]</font> quickly.
<p>
   Out of the office steped a halfling, wearing similar garb as the one who recently spoke, surprising everyone. However, he looked far worse off, and
   the purple streaks covered almost his entire face. He moaned, and, seeing Amber and John, stepped forward with a menacing look on his face.
<p>
The recently awakened halfling recognized his friend. "Jole? Is that *cough* you?" he spoke, trying to get to his feet despite the
   unsteady feeling he felt in his feet and head.
<p>
"WAUughhgdhhkhughggnngnnn!" spoke the halfling, more dead than alive. As if to confirm this, John whispered under his breath, <font face="MS Sans Serif">"un...
   dead?!"</font> The halfling zombie staggered menacingly at Amber and John, apparently not noticing Tilder behind him. As if Finty herself had shaken the
   hourglass of bad luck to emptying, low moans started creeping out from underneath another of the white shrouds.
<p>
From his perspective, Tilder stole a glance into the office. A still form in brown robes lay on the ground inside, blood forming a pool
   from underneath his face-down position.
<p>
<font color="yellow">[[RI: Jole is clearly about to go postal on you. Tilder dextrously gains the initiative (rolls 6, low roll wins, remember), the rest of you roll 9, and feel
   your reactions will coincide with Jole's (who also rolled 9). What will you all do? Tell me your intentions, I'll write out the actions as they occur.]]</font>
<p>* * *<br>
Realizing that the zombie-halfling was lethal, as evidenced 
by the presumed dead mortician in the office ("'It was probably 
nothing,' Finty's foot!"), and having no time to draw his weapon out from 
beneath his tightly-wrapped blanket, Tilder launched himself at Jole, 
hoping in mid-tumble that he could incapacitate the attacker. The overlooked 
halfling sprang first, deciding to tackle his opponent rather than 
cause him, or it, permanent damage. With the element of surprise, Tilder 
jumps for his opponent....

[[RI: Tumbling roll for unarmed combat: 11; success means +2 to hit. 
With THAC0 of 19, Tilder needs 13 to hit. Attack roll: 10 +2 (tumbling) 
+1 (surprise) +2 (rear attack) = 15. Got 'em! (Don't you just love 
AD&amp;D's complicated rules? I had to pull out the book for that one!]]

...and grabs him successfully, tackling Jole, as he was called, pinning 
his arms and bringing him to the floor. His dirty, bloodied but gloved 
hands scraped the floor trying to claw free, but Tilder's grip was too 
strong.
<p>
Amber wasn't sure what the difference between the half-awake, 
half-alive halfling on the table and the crazed, murderous halfing 
zombie coming out of the office, but she wasn't taking any chances. With a 
menacing look and revenge in her eyes she looked at the coherent 
zombie, and decided to take a chance. She barked at him to get on his feet 
and get out. Their would-be attacker having been subdued for the moment, 
she turned to John and spoke. "We need to get us and them," she said, 
indicating Bell and the other mortician, "out of here, John, so that we 
will only be fighting them on one front!" With that said, she looked 
for an opporunity to help Tilder with his quarry.
<p>
Climbing off the table, the 'coherrent zombie' unsteadily 
stepped forward to try to stop Jole from hurting anyone. "Don't worry, 
I'm one of the good guys, even though I might not look it!" he said 
sternly. Drawing his short sword
<font color="yellow">[[WHICH MR. ALMIGHTYDM SAID WAS IN FACT 
STILL ON MY HIP]]</font>, he lunged to behead Jole the 
'WAUughhgdnngnn' Zombie as Tilder tried to hold him. "This will only 
hurt for a moment Jole!" he added somberly, forcing out of his mind the 
fact that Jole was once his friend.

[[RI: With THAC0 of 19, Xanter needs a 13 to hit. Attack Roll: 3 +2 
(defender 'off-balance') +2 (magic sword) = 7. Swish!]]</font>
<p>
Jole squirmed his way out of a nasty beheading just in the nick of 
time, and his would-be executor's sword clanged with blue sparks on the 
cold floor. Xanter raised his sword for a second swing, when suddenly 
another blade entered his field of vision and sank deep into Jole's neck, 
slicing it, then twisted and in a second swing severed it.
<p>
<font color="yellow">
[[RI: Amber took up her favorite past-time: beheading, with 2 rolls 
(specialized in long sword, 3 attacks every 2 rounds) of 17 +2 (defender 
'off-balance') +1 (STR bonus) +1 (specialized in long sword) = 21. (She 
needed a 9.) Damage: 2 x 1d8 +1 (STR bonus) +2 (specialization) = 13. 
Scrunch!]]</font>
<p>
Amber grinned a vengeful grin at Xanter. "Let's get out 
of here!" Together, they dragged Bell and the moritician--named Mort, 
as John pointed out--out of the morgue and into the field.
