<h3 align="center">Furterville history</h3>
<p>
The town of furterville has a long and rich history.  One of the oldest cities in Trassgar, it was 
named for the great magic user the she-elf Furlong the wise and the renowned knight he-elf  
Gyter the Strong.  During the Race Wars of Ancient, they were two heroes that brought peace 
to the warring clans in Northern Trassgar.  To bring an end to the raging, bitter wars, the high 
families of all of the warring clans came together and paired by marriage, in an attempt to unify 
their respective peoples.  Gyter and Furlong were two such members of the Trassgarian High 
Families, nobles by birth.  Gyter, king of the elf clan Harmich, and Furlong, princess of the elf 
clan Turkah, married, thereby joining their two families, and thus not only their combined 
wealth and land, but their combined power.  Their marriage unified the Northeast region of 
Trassgar, and the ancient town of Raquarh was renamed Furterville in their honor.  They 
established their marriage by building their castle in the center of their combined lands—a mere 
mile from Furterville.  From there, they ruled, and developed one of the most prosperous and 
content kingdoms in all the land.
<p>
In order to secure the new Trassgarian High Family structure, the paired nobles had many 
children.  Gyter and Furlong begat Kinra (female), hetig (male), furji (male), garnet (female), 
lem (male), xesa (female), and igrem (male).   They taught their children to speak all the 
languages of the peoples they governed, and attempted to discern their gifts and hone their 
natural skills.  Kinra and hetig were natural warriors.  Furji, with his soft-spoken, tender smile, 
could melt anyone’s heart.  He was too kindhearted to be anything but a priest.  Garnet simply 
wanted to learn, and loved playing in the garden.  She became the cleric of the family.  Lem, 
always the mischievous one, wanted nothing more than to play tricks on others.  It would 
delight him for hours.  As a result, he was apprenticed to a thief.  Xesa seemed to inherit the gift 
of magic like her mother.  She spent long hours at her mother’s side, learning the ways of magic 
use.  And Igrem, the little one, wasn’t very bright.  However, given the opportunity to play 
outside the castle walls in the forest, he would be gone for hours, and none could find him until 
he wanted to be found, to his parents’ dismay.  He was apprenticed to a ranger.
All of the children that lived married well.  The two that did not marry were Garnet, who was 
killed while traveling to Cactus Ridge by a party of orc raiders, and Furji, who was a priest and 
much too occupied with helping others to think enough about himself to even consider taking a 
wife.
<p>
By the time King Gyter and Queen Furlong had passed away, Kinra and her husband, a man of 
noble birth by the name of Yhebig, were well prepared to succeed them.  Hetig assumed the 
position of Military Advisor, Lem was their Intelligence Source, Xesa was the kingdom wizard, 
Igrem advised them on crops and production, and Furji wandered from place to place blessing, 
healing, and generally fostering contentment among the people.  
The history of the remainder of the Turkah/Harmich branch of the Trassgarian High Family is 
well documented as the History of the Third House of Trassgar.

<p>
Furterville is a semi-mountainous, fertile area of Northeastern Trassgar.  Much of the 
land in still tall, beautiful wood filled with fruit trees and various animals good for trapping and 
hunting.  The other two types of land in this area are mountainside, which is advantageous 
strategically, and fertile plains, which are farmed by and large by the peasants.
