</h3>

This city is the home of the famed hermit/healer Selanass.  On
the road to this city from Central Trassgar, there are dangerous
avalanches, ice monsters, fanged pterovultures, narrow roads and
deep chasms.  Only the bravest of travelers dare make the journey
to the intentionally secluded fortress of Ice City.
<p />
During the Original Adventures, the Trassgar adventurers traveled
to Ice City to pick up Gnash from a long recuperation at the hands
of its healers.  Along the way they discovered the Ancient Prophecy of Bolario:
<p />
<em>

   <span class="orange">
From the Cave of Punishment<br>
To the Altar of Ashes you brought me.<br>
You climbed to the Tree of Struggling<br>
And formed me.<br>
And now you must place me on my<br>
Courtyard of Ashes.
   </span>
</center>
</em>
<p>

This prophesy of Bolario was fulfilled by the adventurers, and the ancient library of Ice City
was finally revealed after being sealed for centuries.  The healers Gallimand and Sellyano
were quite happy of the opening of the library, and Gnash was very happy to see some
secular faces and leave the isolated fortress!
