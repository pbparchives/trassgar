From the Cave of Punishment<br>

You climbed to the Tree of Struggling<br>

And now you must place me on my<br>

This prophesy of Bolario was fulfilled by the adventurers, and the ancient library of Ice City
was finally revealed after being sealed for centuries.  The healers Gallimand and Sellyano
were quite happy of the opening of the library, and Gnash was very happy to see some
secular faces and leave the isolated fortress!
