<font color="yellow">From the moment he had been transported to
Trassgar from his native world, Stor Restyl had wondered what it was that
made fate lead him and his friends to this strange world.</font>
Of course, at first, he thought he was alone.  By a quirk of magic, Stor had
been separated from his friends, had been captured by a crew of Klaxton Kurl's
henchmen, had been tortured, battered, bruised, and gagged, then had been
rescued by Boxer Boy--or Olen Orfeus or whatever he was calling himself now,
Slick, Gargy and a really foxy elf-woman.
<p>
Now, weeks after his arrival in Trassgar, Stor found himself enjoying
the walk from Furterville back to Forest's Edge, and decided that fate had led
him here for a good reason.  They'd rescued countless villagers and some
royalty too, had uncovered some plots of the bad guy of the land, Klaxton Kurl,
and he had even got himself a nifty ring from the healers at Ice City.
No more falling down cliffs for him!
<p>
All his adventures in Trassgar had taught him one thing, if not more--you
have to trust your friends, and look out for them, as they look out for you.
He surveyed the group of friends, old and new, who walked ahead of him.
There was his best friend Olen, trying to impress Scurge with his cantrips.
Ahead of them walked Gnash and Amber, whom he guessed were as close as
siblings could be, except oddly enough, she was an elf--a high elf, to
boot--and he was a gruff dwarf.  He thought he saw Amber pull Gnash's
scraggly hair, and to her delight he turned and fired a withering look at Olen.
Olen of course, flashed Gnash a look of pure innocence, which was of course,
easy to do since he had not taken part in the trickery.  Gnash grumbled some
unintelligible dwarven phrase.  Stor had a feeling he was better off not
understanding it.  And then, Stor always made sure he kept an eye or two on
Gargamel.  Even now Gargy was trying to pick the pockets of the crazy
barbarian, just so he could get poor Slahm into wondering how his
money pouch had vanished again.
<em>Olen'll probably get blamed for that one too,</em> Stor
mused.  Slahm never understood how though his money pouch always disappeared
and reappeared, he never actually lost any money.  Perhaps Gargy was just
practicing, or perhaps he was too kind for a thief.  These moments of respite
from the dangers of their tasks, both past and future,
gave them hope and unity.  They needed these fleeting spells of warmth and
fun--to prepare them for the trials ahead.  
<p>
Yes, the journeys had taken them all through so much together.  Most recently,
however, he wondered how it was that they had overtaken the invaders at the
Castle of The Third House so easily.  The folks they'd rescued were terribly
grateful, and had let them stay a while to recuperate and regain their
strength.  But it all seemed too good, too simple.  <em>Maybe I'm just
becoming jaded and suspicious,</em> Stor thought, and
involuntarily his mind began wandering to all of the reasons he had to be
just that.
<p>
It all started so innocently.  If only they hadn't been so curious; but then,
Stor couldn't say that he wanted to erase the past adventures.  So maybe that
ring of pink mushrooms was a blessing, a virtual gateway to manhood, something
that had previously eluded Stor, Slahm, Olen, Slick, and
Gargamel.  Whatever its significance, it marked the beginning of a whole new
life for the adventuring quintet.  <em>I'm just glad that they came and
rescued me,</em> Stor thought, <em>Only my luck would put me, alone,
in the middle of a horde of black sashes, and put the others together
in some safe little town.</em>  But, that was in the past.  Only he still had
nightmares about the beatings and torture from those days of imprisonment.
Thank the gods, the other four had made sure he was found, in part by
enlisting the assistance of a mysterious she-elf with an attitude
and a burly dwarf with a strange sense of humor.
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
Before too long, Stor and his compatriots had come upon the Lanagg River,
but not by means of the well-traveled roads between Furterville,
through the mining town of Himm and on to Forest's Edge.  Amber had said it
would be safer to venture through the plains
and forests.  Being an elven ranger gave her twice the authority in
pathfinding, and the rest of them had readily agreed.  She knew of an old
rope-bridge over the river that was not used much in recent times because of
the more sturdy wooden bridges the dwarves had constructed further to the east.
<p>
They could see not far ahead the edge of the canyon carved by the river,
and the through the trees Stor could make out this side of the rope bridge.
They paused at the edge of the forest and surveyed the clearing between them
and the bridge.  It was a good minute's jog at best to the river.
<p>
"Well, gentlemen, pack your gear tightly, and make sure all of your loose
items are secured.  If you drop something into the river, it's lost forever,"
Amber stated.
<p>
"Could we be any MORE obvious?" Olen muttered grudgingly.
<p>
"Olen!" Scurge hissed.
<p>
Stor chuckled as Amber looked sidelong at Olen.  Whether or not she heard
him he couldn't tell, but if she did, she made no rebuttal.  They had always
been at odds, but it seemed that they enjoyed the rivalry.  The others weren't
quite brave enough to intervene.  To make a red-headed
elf and a quirky wizard angry at the same time... well, even Slahm had more
brains than that.
<p>
Stor looked up to see Gnash flash across the bridge.  He hadn't even noticed
that he'd left their company.  "One down and seven to go, eh Olen?" Stor joked
as he slung his bow over his head and shoulder, and made sure he was wearing
his ring.
<p>
"Seven?" came Olen's puzzled reply.  He was busily packaging his favorite
spell components.
<p>
"Sure.  Slahm counts as at least two, don't you think?" Stor and Olen laughed
together.  Stor quickly glanced at the half-orc Slahm to make sure he hadn't
heard the snide remark.  He hadn't.
He was trying to figure out how to tie down the boulders he carried as
Gargamel tried to convince
him he could always leave them and find other ones.  Meanwhile, Slahm's
falcon-in-training sat patiently on the big half-man's shoulder, ruffling
his feathers.
<p>
Each set off for the bridge after they readied their belongings.  By the time
Stor reached the bridge, Amber and Slahm and joined Gnash on the other side,
and Gargamel was on his way across.  Stor gripped the ropes with his gloved
hands.  <em>Seems sturdy enough, I suppose.</em>  He looked down.  Not a
terribly long drop, but flashbacks of his past tumbles down various cliffs
haunted him.
<p>
"Don't look down, human," Olen said seriously.
<p>
"Right.  Don't look down," Stor repeated aloud.  He reassuringly tensed his
right fist and felt the pressure of the metal ring on his index finger.  He
started across, and tried not to look down.  The bridge creaked, groaned,
and stretched with the added weight.  Ahead, he could see that it also swayed
with the wind swirling in the canyon.
<p>
When he was almost half-way across, Stor suddenly stopped.  Sweating profusely,
he swallowed hard.  <em>Is that Olen cracking his knuckles behind me, or is
that the sound that rope makes...</em>
<p>
POP!  <em>...when it snaps!</em>
<p>
The bridge suddenly jolted as one of the bottom supports started to give way
to age, the elements, and the weight it was trying to hold.  Stor looked down,
despite himself, and saw that another rope was unraveling only steps in front
of him.  He looked up again, and shouted to Gargamel.
<p>
"Book it!  This bridge is about to collapse!"  The archer attempted to turn
around and retreat to the other side of the bridge, and could see Olen gasping
with disbelief.  Scurge had barely begun her traversal of the canyon herself.
<em>At least we thought to spread out!  Not spread out enough, I guess!</em>
<p>
With the snap of the second support, the remaining quickly unraveled.  Scurge
jumped for the edge <font color="yellow">[dex check: 12 Yea!]</font>
before the bridge fell from under her, but Olen and Stor plunged toward the
rocky shores below as the bridge split and the ends hung in shambles on either
side of the canyon.
<p>
It was magic that brought Stor to this land which had continually put him
through peril, and it was now magic that saved him.  As the frayed ropes
slipped past his feet, he felt the pull of gravity very suddenly, and he
tumbled forward.  Then, just as suddenly as Stor lost his footing, the magic
of his ring cushioned his fall through mid air and
he felt as if he were riding the breeze.  Before he could enjoy the sensation,
he heard a terrified scream from above.  Olen Orpheas!
<p>
Stor raised his head and arms instinctively, and saw his wizard friend falling
straight for him.  His next instinct was to get out of the way, but having no
grounding, he was helpless to avoid the fast-falling mass of robes,
spell components, and half-elf.  He reached for
Olen <font color="yellow">[dex check: 4 Yea!]</font> and took hold of his
friend.  <em>Will the magic of this ring hold us both?</em> Stor wondered to
himself.  <em>And, will I be able to hold Olen?</em>
<font color="yellow">[str check: 19 Doh!]</font>
<p>
Olen uttered a muffled cry as his downward plunge was suddenly halted,
but only briefly, as Stor could not retain his grip.  As he slipped past Stor,
Olen grabbed for his legs.
<font color="yellow">[dex check: 20 Double Doh!]</font>  To Stor and Olen's
double dismay, Stor's pants begin to rip, and before anything could be done,
Olen Orpheas and Stor's pants were falling to their mutual doom.  Stor looked
down with panic until he realized that by this point,
the river shore was a mere eight lengths below them.  
<p>
Olen hit the ground <font color="yellow">[1d6 dam/10 lengths: 1pt]</font>,
bruising his right side on the rocks, but without the feared SPLAT. As he
looked up he saw Stor smiling at him and gliding down to join him. 
On the opposite canyon rim, Amber, Gnash, and Slahm looked
down with relief, and then averted their gaze to Gargamel, who was scaling
the remains of the rope bridge to join them. <font color="yellow">[climb roll:
21% yea!]</font>  Looking toward his
own side of the canyon, Stor could see the fringes of what he recognized
to be Scurge, fumbling through a pack--no doubt searching for some rope.
<p>
After recovering all parties from the canyon floor, the group, separated by
a turbulent and uncrossable river, decided to make their way to Forest's Edge
in two groups.  The first to arrive was to get supplies and rest at HQ in the
High Safe Inn until the others arrived.  Stor guessed that he, Olen and Scurge
would reach Forest's Edge after the others, since they had to
journey downriver until they found a place to cross before journeying onward.
<p>
With a final wave to their friends across the river, Stor turned to Olen and
Scurge.  <em>"Some shortcut!"</em> he thought, and then said to Olen and
Scurge, "Well, lovebirds, now that the shortcut saved us all that time, I guess we better find another bridge to cross."

It seemed like a week, but it had only been one day and one night since the
friends had split up at the Lanagg river.</font>
<p>
"Sleep spell'll do that to ya," Olen explained to Stor, who had been constantly
rubbing his eyes since they left their campsite--and the pyre of a former
Aalam dark-elf.  "Or don't you remember that from the last time you got
put under through magic?"
<p>
"I remember, you weasel," Stor replied, shaking his head.  Volunteering to
be the dummy target for Olen's practicing was one of the dumbest things he'd
ever been talked into by the half-elf.
<p>
"<em>I</em> don't remember.  Sounds like a good story to me, boys."
Scurge cupped one
ear playfully in Olen's direction, her lips twisted in an expectant
expression.
<p>
"Uh, well, you see--hey, what do you mean, 'boys'?"  Stor interrupted himself.
<p>
Scurge once again offered her unique chuckle and continued her stride westward
through the tall grass on the Lanagg's north bank.  Her laugh was starting to
grown on the friends from Aalam.  Yes, they'd definitely keep her in their
company, each decided independently.
<p>
"Hey native <em>girl</em>," Olen began sarcastically, but quickly his voice
faded with exhaustion.  "How much longer 'til we reach Forest's Edge again?"
<p>
"Well, with Himm just an hour behind us, it should be several hours more."
Scurge looked at Olen and pitied the visibly worn wizard.  She wished she
could have been there with him last night, although a battle between a powerful
dark elf and an ancient dragon wasn't high on her list of events to be in
the middle of.  Olen knew the route and distance back to their gathering
place at the High Safe, but she sensed his question was more an outward show
of his desire to keep moving and less a genuine query.
<p>
Stor nodded, yawning and rubbing his eyes again.  "You sure you don't want to
stop for a minute?  Splash some water on your face or something?  Shiel!
You haven't slept in two days!"
<p>
"We keep moving."  Olen had repeated it as if it were a healing mantra.
Both his companions knew he wanted to put as much distance between himself
and Lanagg Post as he possibly could, and as fast as possible, moreover.
<p>
"Right."
<p>
<center>* * *</center>
<p>
They reached Forest's Edge by late evening.  Stor had once more offered to
stop and rest
at the main bridge across the Lanagg on the path, but Olen had reminded
him that the last time they had tarried at the bridge, they were ambushed by
some rogues, and even spotted a black nymph.  Stor had reminded Olen that since
those rogues weren't going to bother anyone tonight--or ever, he didn't mind
so much the pause, especially if they happened to spot the nymph again.
<p>
"I'll bet!  When's the last time you kissed a girl, anyway?"  Scurge had poked.
<p>
Stor's scowl had gone unnoticed as he trudged past his friends ahead and
across the river.
<p>
Forest's Edge was enjoying its usual business, and as the three approached the
east gate, Olen finally gave in to his weariness and stumbled.  It took them
another fifteen minutes to help the spellcaster down the streets to Bar
Alley.  They finally paused at one of the street wells, where Stor forced
Olen to sit and drink some water that hadn't been sitting in a leather canteen
for hours.  Soon, they approached the front steps of the High
Safe Inn, where they found a small pony with a stained saddle barely
tethered to the wooden railing surrounding the front porch.
<p>
The horse grunted at their approach, as if to
say, "watch your step, clumsy bipedals!" and Stor, Olen and Scurge
ascended the steps to their gathering place.
<p>
By the time mid-night arrived, Klive had welcomed them back with a round of
leftovers--admittedly not generous portions since a burly and hungry dwarf
had nearly cleaned out the kitchen.  Olen was nearly asleep after just a few
bites, so Scurge and Stor finished their helpings quickly.
<p>
On the way to the back stairs, Stor thought to comment to the proprietor and
their host.  "I suppose the others beat us back, huh sir?"
<p>
Klive smiled.  "Yep.  Your pals is upstairs right now, except for Amber,
but don't worry about her."  He clapped Stor on the back as he held
the door open for them, smiling.  "Gnash'll fill you in on your next big
adventure in the morning."
<p>
"Next big adventure?" Stor squeaked wearily.
<p>
Soon, the High Safe Inn was
closed for newcomers, its new door locked, the windows closed, its residents
all asleep.  But none dreamed more vividly than Olen, who, wearing only
his loose-fitting half trousers--"boxers" he called them, tossed and turned
most of the night.  Stor and Scurge and had closed the shutters to his room,
not wanting even the moonslight to disturb him.  But the room was not hidden
in the dark.  As Olen dreamed, his staff, the staff of his teacher, resting
comfortably against the bed side table and wall, re-awakened with a soft,
almost golden, glow.
