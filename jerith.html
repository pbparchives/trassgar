<h2 align="center">Jerith's Saga</h2>

<h3 align=center>
<a name="1">

</h3>

<em>"I am cursed,"</em> Jerith half-thought, half-mumbled to himself,
gulping down the last bit of this strange brew the barkeep called 'ale.'
<em>"I have known this ever since the hateful sea god blew me to a
distant realm, far larger than my own."</em>
The hobgoblin's thoughts swam through the river of his memories
of the past several weeks, as he slouched back into his wooden seat at a
rickety table in the shadows of the tavern.
<em>"Here they have never heard of the Blackshields, the feared
warriors that have crushed all before them."</em>
<p>
Jerith tried to evaluate his situation,
tried to look on the positive side of things.
If there were one.  <em>"But I am not without friends among the gods....
Ajatusk the battle lord kept me alive long after my potion should have
expired.  I am his chosen, and he will not let the sea god kill me.
But Manawydan has slaves everywhere, even here I
encountered some not moments after I was swept up half dead on the beach.
They thought I was dying; he sent them to finish the job.
They thought I wouldn't fight."</em>
<p>
He clenched his eyes shut, trying to hold back the onslaught of
memories of his first encounter on the shores of this distant land.
<em>"They were gravely mistaken.  Now they are all dead and I have to
wonder what their intentions were. A blind rage
masked my thoughts-did I slaughter innocents? I doubt it,
them wearing the sigil of the sea god. But what if this happens again?
For days I was cursed by this thought. I wandered into a town inhabited by
tall, slender folk -- elves, they call themselves, and
worked as a thug for a couple of weeks.  Now I sit here,
as drunk as I am able to get with only a half dozens silvers."</em>
After another gulp, he muttered, <em>"I can brew better stuff than this
blindfolded."</em>  When Jerith opened his eyes, he saw an old,
short, hairy, fellow standing before him.  Still mumbling to himself,
Jerith continued, ignoring his guest.
<em>"An old halfling has approached me.  Like the rest of the people I
meet here, he probably thinks I am some avatar of his monster god.
<p>
People here have never seen the glorious hobgoblins before."</em>
<p>
"Hello, there," the halfling spoke in a soft, wise voice.
"You've been mumbling to yourself all night.  Would you like some company?"
Before Jerith could speak, the halfling had jumped up to sit on a chair
next to Jerith, and stared at the hobgoblin with curious eyes and a
wrinkled smile.
<p>
<center>* * * * *</center>
<p>
Jerith was amused with the old halfling's demeanor and related his story. The
story of how he came from a land no one seems to know, and found himself here
in a land he'd never known.
<p>
The halfling, Meriadoc, told Jerith that he knew where he could find the
help he needed.  People who might even know a way to get back to Demetia.
<p>
Jerith scoffed alound at the oldling's claim.
"Not unless they are the kind of idiots than
can fly in the star globe or under the water.  Weren't you listening?
The sea god will any crush any vehicle that comes near her."
<p>
He had stood up to leave and the last of his silvers clinked together.
Then he remembered why he had this money....
<p>
There was someone he had to kill.

</p>

Jerith walked out of the bar, shoving an entering human aside.
The human, a tough looking man, but also a very smart one, decided to
leave the monster alone. 

<p align="center">* * *</p>

"He'll be near the old bridge, he's always there at night,
gathering the mushrooms.  He says he's a wizard.  He says he speaks to gods.
He says he's going to destroy the whole city."
<p>
"So what's the problem?"
<p>
"Six silvers right now if you ask no questions."

<p align="center">* * *</p>

In the dark of dusk, Jerith's infravision saw the elf clearly.
The elf must have heard him but paid no mind.  Jerith saw the mushrooms
he was walking through; he had heard tells of certain bars where the ale was
mixed with these things for hallucinogenic effects.
He half filled his pouch with some on his way to the elf.
<p>
"You can't stop me." the elf spoke.  He didn't look old, but with elves
that didn't mean much.  "You can't change anything.  I will bring
this world down...."
<p>
Jerith chuckled; it wasn't every day an elf went insane,
although the mushrooms probably didn't help.
<p>
"Evil!  Evil is everywhere, I see the black sashes!  The death!
The locathah will return!"
<p>
<em>"Locathah.... no way!"</em>  The thought made Jerith pause.
They were dead in Demetia, he had assumed none lived here.
But what if they did.  Prophecy or no prophecy, Jerith was committed to
his task.  This elf was toast.
<p>
Jerith heard the swish of air usually accompanied by a projectile.
It barely missed him.  He turned, and a crossbow bolt hit Jerith
on the side of his waist <span class="DM">[Lvl 2 elven fighter,
THAC0 (missile) 18 vs. Jerith's AC of 4, needs 14, rolls 9 (surprise round),
18 (RND 1). 3 dmg]</span>.  The sound of an arbelest being wound reached
Jerith's ears quickly.  He turned and charged, and saw the blood.  His blood.
<span class="DM">[Wis check at -2 for reaction to

the crossbow wielder....
<p>
<span class="DM">[RND 2 initiative: Jerith 4, elf warrior 3]</span>
The elf, seeing he would be dead if he took the time to wind the crossbow,
drew out a short sword and very quickly grabbed a buckler shield.  
Before Jerith could bring about his weapon, the elf swung his short sword. 
<span class="DM">[Elf THAC0 melee 19 vs Jerith AC 4, needs 15, rolls 19,
HIT! 5 dmg]</span> Determined to live, he struck at the heart,
striking Jerith in the upper torso and seriously wounding the monster,
but not taking the fight out of him.  The sight of more blood 
and the pounding in his veins spurred Jerith toward a kill.  Jerith's first
hit creased down the elf's left arm <span class="DM">[Jerith THAC0 20 vs.
Elf AC 8, needs 12, rolls 20, 4+2 dmg]</span> causing him to drop
the shield he hadn't strapped on yet.  Jerith's follow-up slash passed
over the panicked elf's head <span class="DM">[Att #2, rolls 6]</span>.
<p>
<span class="DM">[RND 3 initiative: Jerith 8, Elf 4]</span>
The elf, not willing to conceed defeat, struck back with a thrust to the gut
<span class="DM">[Elf rolls 13, miss]</span> but lacked the strength
to push through the hobgoblin's armor.  Jerith whirled with
his blade bringing about a roundhouse strike with the power to behead the
doomed elf--
<p>
A shriek from the wizard man cut him off.
He stopped the blade before it could nick the
elf's neck <span class="DM">[Jerith rolls 5, miss!]</span>.
<p>
"Spare me..." the elf groaned, stunned and shaken.
"Mercy, in the name of the Ikra...." 
Jerith looked into the elf's glowing eyes.  He saw the need to live,
the happy days of this still young elf.  He saw the crossbow bolt shot
in the dark, the one meant to kill him; further back still he saw a bloody
fox's skull on a pike, he heard the initiation of the warriors of Ajatusk....
Any thoughts of mercy were promptly overcome.

<p align="center">* * *</p>

Jerith turned around.
<em>"Not much time until someone shows up."</em>  The sounds of battle and
death had a way of attracting passersby.  But the wizard elf was gone.
<p>
It took seconds to find him, hiding and cowering in a bush.
It only took one strike.  Then he made his escape.  He half-stumbled,
half-ran back into the town and threw himself behind the garbage pile next
to the tavern.  As he laid there, exhausted and bleeding, he 
heard the angry voice of an elven warrior calling for a search party,
passing in the dark.  <em>"No one will find me here,"</em> he thought,
and before he lapsed into sleep, he wondered if the six silver pieces was a
price worth the evil he'd sown further into his soul.

</p>

<span class="DM">The smell of fresh animal casings jarred Jerith to
wakefulness, even before their wetness on his back permeated his
clothing.</span>
<p>
<em>"Oooh..."</em>
<p>
It was just barely dawn.
Jerith looked at the few stars visible from behind the cloudy, half-lit sky
and wondered if he should count them as lucky since he had survivid his
mercenary effort.  Before the hobgoblin, dried blood crusting from his near
mortal wounds, could survey his situation further, he heard angry voices
once again.
<p>
"Sir, we've searched the East, and can find no sign of the murderer.
I suggest we comb the town.  As unlikely as it may seem, he may have been
just crazy enough to try to hide here.  Our other contingent should scour
the West," a young voice reported.
<p>
"Very well.  You are sure he could not have gotten by you to the East?"
an experienced, raspy voice replied.
<p>
"Yes sir.  He is either in this town or has fled West.  I fear that he may
already have too big a head start on us; but we owe it to Jasprik to try
and avenge him."
<p>
"Agreed.  Begin your search.  I will spearhead the group responsible for
seeking the assassin here in the village."
<p>
<em>"East,"</em> thought Jerith, <em>"the East is clear.
How fortunate that that is the way to Kahdyr...
Perhaps the gods have not completely forsaken me after all."</em>
And with that, he began looking for his opportunity to make a get away.
<p>
As it turned out, he didn't have to wait long.  As luck would have it,
the team searching the township began on the outer edge of the other side
of town, leaving him a clear window through the back alleys of the bars for
escape.  <em>"After all,"</em> he thought, <em>"no one frequents
bars in the morning,"</em> and he began making his way to the Eastern Wood.
<p>
It seemed that his path to the East was going to be smooth sailing, until,
as he approached the end of the alley he was traversing,
he saw a guard posted at the edge of town near a simple wooden gate
stretched between two tall oaks.  The man was burly, large, and looked
well-equipped.  However, he seemed to be quite occupied with a piece of
wood he was whittling.  <em>"Could I slip by him?"</em> Jerith wondered to
himself, concerned that a confrontation would result in his untimely demise.
There was no other way out of town, and he was all too aware that capture by
the townspeople would result in his execution. 

<p>
<h3 align=center>

</p>

Jerith saw the one guard, his back turned. Thoughts streamed through
Jerith's mind.  <em>"What to do, what to do. Okay, rationalize. Mission: get
the hell out of here."</em> Jerith ruled out an attack. The people weren't
generally a race to mess with, but he already had. And he just might
get away with it. <em>"They seemed loyal to each other, but to what else?"</em>
That might be the place to strike.
<p>
Jerith's guard wasn't let down at all as he approached. The guard turned
and saw Jerith, both of thier feet were planted in the mud, as firmly
as possible as a light rain started.
<p>
The guard was silent, not impressed, but definitely feeling
threatened.  His shield was up and so was the strange sword these
humans used.  His whittling he had dropped to a stump near the path.
Then, recognition struck.
<p>
"I saw you... at the bar last night," the guard offered.  "You pushed me when
I was coming in.  Bastard."
<p>
The human swung his long sword, Jerith
<span class="DM">[Jerith parries, -1 to AC.  Stoybin THAC0 19 - Jerith
AC 4-1 = 16.  Rolls 4, 8]</span>
parried the first blow with his scimitar, but the human was fast and
brought up a stabbing motion, meant to cripple him. But Jerith brought
the shield low. "You killed Jasprik," the guard cursed.
<p>
<em>"True, true,"</em> Jerith moaned in his
mind.  <em>"Let me speak, give me breath...."</em>
<p>
The guard swung his sword again
<span class="DM">[Combat round 2.  Jerith still parrying,
Stoybin rolls 12]</span> but this time the blow was
too far off. Jerith had just enough time to step aside.
<p>
"You don't care." Jerith finally rasped aloud in the common tongue this human
would understand. "You've felt it too haven't you. The
worm-spawned elves here. They hate you, and you know it." It was a
gamble, and it failed. The human guard was about to strike again....
<p>
"LISTEN!" Jerith just barely managed to speak.  "You don't want
to kill me. You don't want to live this life. Guarding this town? for
what? What is it that you feel is worth your life?"
<p>
The human, by name of Stoybin Arripedes, a guard in the Birith Militia, paused.
<p>
"I heard about some people who can help us. Far to the east, right out
this gate." The human's young eyes wandered involuntarily.
<p>
"Somewhere out there, I'm sure there are people just like us:
warriors.  Who want to rule for themselves. No more sitting waiting for
someone better to come and kill us. No more risking our lives while
the normal people go about thier dull lives. You feel it don't you?
<i>The blood of Ajatusk flows in your veins.</i>"
<p>
There was no way the human could have known the name. But he got the
meaning. His sword and shield were lowered. "Get the hell out of
here." he muttered, looking the other way.
<p>
Jerith dashed past the city marker, then turned around. "Aren't you coming with
me, brother?"

<p>

</p>

<span class="DM">Stoybin considered what the strange orange-skinned
creature said to him.</span>  Perhaps it was the fierceness with which the
invader had assulted him with his words instead of steel.  Perhaps,
notwithstanding
the raspy tone of the tall humanoid's voice, it was the verity of his words
that echoed in Stoybin's mind.  But, to go with the creature, leave his post,
his decent paying job, his customary seat at his friends' gambling table?
<p>
"I will go with you, creature," Stoybin offered, sheathing his sword, and
retrieving his carving.  <em>"There will be plenty of time to challenge
you to a more matched fight later,"</em> he thought, noticing the blood leaking
from wounds in the creature's side.  He disliked this
stranger.  Hated him for the murders he'd committed the night before.  Jasprik,
the old fool, and his aide didn't deserve such a brutal ending.  No one did.
Death in combat should be the result of a fair, balanced, honorable combat.
His earlier instinct to attack the creature out of hate had blinded his deeper
sense of that honor.  An honor he had not felt reason to claim for many years.
"But I warn you, there is a price on your head.
Two elves whose lives are a debt you cannot repay but with your own."
Stoybin glared down at the long-eared one whom he addressed.
"I look forward to settling that debt once you are strong enough to challenge
me in earnest."

<p align="center">* * *</p>

Jerith believed this human to be a fool for having lowered his sword, but at the
same time respected anyone who felt fear at the name of his god Ajatusk.  The
human's sense of honor also made him pause to reevaluate his contemptable
opinion of the taller races he'd encountered on this land--Trassgar
as it was called here.
Jerith had several days, before he was up to full strength, to change the man's
mind about the death sentence he intended to carry out.  In that amount of time,
he would figure out what to do with this human, and his
overactive sense of honor.  For now, though,
it would be good to have a well-armed soldier in his company.  Looking down at
his reopened wounds reminded him of that fact.

<p align="center">* * *</p>

They had carefully introduced themselves as they left Birith behind them.
Stoybin did not seem to have any ties to Birith that kept him from abandoning
his post.
Instead of the capricious demeanor carried by those not at peace with their rash
decisions, Jerith noticed that Stoybin focused completely on asking questions
about the details of the people he sought in the East, as well as the race of
creatures Jerith called his own.
<p>
"I am of the hobgoblin race, a fierce, proud people who live in a land far
from here," Jerith began.  He did not concern himself with betraying his life's
story to this man.
The knowledge of men destined for death was but a trifle to him.  "My
clan is the
Blackshields, and we conquered our home land from the locathah who ruled it.
Demetia.  My home.  It is far from here, and my only clue on how to return
lies with these Easterners."
<p>
Stoybin spoke up.  "You must mean the elves who live in Kahdyr.
The priests there are the wisest in all of northern Trassgar.
If anyone knows how to get back to your land it would be them."
Stoybin noticed that although this creature--this hobgoblin--must
be in pain and in deep fatigue from the events of the past few nights, he 
displayed not a grimace nor a wince.
<p>
"Elves?" Jerith looked dismayed.  "You mean the elves are the people I seek?"
He had had enough of these elves, although they were good cooks and didn't
seem to mind an obvious outsider to wander among the streets of Birith.
<p>
"Yes.  Elves.  We'll actually find them in all of Trassgar.
They are the First Race.  Some elves say they are the <em>only</em> race,
native to this land, anyway."

<p align="center">* * *</p>

Stoybin wondered if the elves were once present in Demetia,
and if the hobgoblins had driven them away.  A topic for another conversation.
For now, he was content with Jerith's
story; satisfied with the journey the hobgoblin was undertaking.
<p>
The real question was this: was he at ease with his own journey?
A glance at the gold ring he wore on his right index finger,
tarnished and dirtied over years of neglect, begged him for an answer.

</p>

<span class="DM">They spent the rest of the morning in silence,
and when the light of the day was at its brightest, they stopped to rest.</span>
Stoybin offered his water
skin to his traveling companion after he had taken a few refreshing swallows
himself.  Jerith refused the drink with a wave of his gnarled hand.
<p>
"Come on Jerith, you know you're thirsty," Stoybin offered with mixed feelings.
To offer a drink to a "man" destined to taste death at the steel of his sword
seemed wasteful.  Yet, he insisted on a more matched fight.  Although the
hobgoblin's wounds were not openly bleeding, he knew Jerith still felt the
pain and definitely the fatigue of the previous night's murderous exploits.
<p>
Jerith balked, seemed to consider refusing a second time.  But then he
stretched out his hand to take the skin from Stoybin.  "Can't let you drink
it all.  Besides, I need my strength for our fight, right?"
<p>
His sarcasm was biting, but Stoybin refused to acknowledge it.  After
Jerith had taken just one swallow, he capped the container and flipped it
back to its owner.  He wiped his mouth with the back of his hand and looked
skyward, then back to the east.
<p>
"How much further until we get there, human?" Jerith spoke, bypassing any
thanks and not even looking in Stoybin's direction.
<p>
"Hm, Kahdyr."  Stoybin scratched the stubble on his chin.  "At this pace,
we'll hit the lake sometime tomorrow, and from there it's probably a couple
or three more days."  <em>"If you survive that long, murderer..."</em>
<p>
"Then let's get with it, Stoybin.  Every hour I spend walking this foreign
soil is another hour I would rather be back in my own land."  Jerith
started off again down the barely-worn path, and Stoybin picked himself
up and followed, shaking his head at Jerith's arrogance.

<p align="center">* * *</p>

The afternoon of the next day found the travelers atop a grassy hill that
overlooked a plateau that was higher in altitude and greener in color than
the land they'd traversed.  No longer were
they on any kind of well-traveled path.  The path had forked a few miles back,
and instead of taking either of the trails that eventually led to small
settlements to the north and southeast, they continued their journey east.
<p>
In the middle of the green expanse was a lake of blue.  Buried in the
hills in this northern stretch of Trassgar was a powerful spring that filled
up the shallow valleys formed by the rocky bases of the hills.  The
resulting basin of water, Stomerd Lake, spilled out between two of the
southern ridges and formed the Furter River which flowed south and west
to Furterville.
<p>
"Beautiful..." Stoybin remarked, his thoughts and gaze focused on and
beyond the waters below them.
<p>
"It's a lake."  Jerith retorted, not impressed.
<p>
"Yeah," the militia man replied.  "That's a lake."  Stoybin sighed.  "But
I wasn't talking about the lake."  Memories of the previous warm season,
and of <em>her</em>
were on the forefront of his mind, and he fought them to keep focused on
their journey, even if that meant looking down to <em>that</em> lake.
<p>
"You humans don't make any sense."  Jerith found himself mimicking a human
expression of exasperation as he rolled his eyes and mumbled to himself.
<em>"Entook!  May Ajatusk
himself strike me down if I have to spend many more days away from Demetia.
This trip better prove worth the effort."</em>
<p>
Stoybin ignored the hobgoblin.  He saw movement on the water.  It was some
kind of boat--a raft, maybe.
<p>
"Let's check it out," Stoybin suggested.  But Jerith was already descending
the hill to the bank of the lake.  <em>"The same shore...."</em>  He pushed
the memories from his head and started his own descent.

</p>

<span class="DM">In the town of Birith, a funeral service was held for
Jasprik and his aide who died defending him.</span>
During the service, held at Birith Memorial Field, the town's northern
cemetery situated in the hilly land outside the town's main perimeter,
an elven priest, dressed in long robes that hid his feet, stood and
read from a book of traditional Ikran prayers.
It was not quite one full day since the two elves had been murdered.
<p>
The townfolk who paid their respects at the grave site were few in number.
Most knew of Jasprik, and among those who did know him, many avoided him
as he was apt to prophesy such horrible tales of the demise of the city,
even the whole land.
<p>
"And may the Great Light see fit to grant," he spoke, motioning to the
two wooden coffins nearby two freshly dug gravesites, "Jasprik and Colt
a long life in the hereafter, as their time in this life has come to an end."
There was a sniffle from one of those gathered and a muffled sob from another.
The rest stood in silence.
<p>
Suddenly, a voice was heard from below, down the hill, echoing something
inaudible from its current distance to the funeral rite.  One elf turned
his head slightly to try to hear better.  Others followed suit, and soon
even the priest looked up from his old, worn tome to pay attention to the
voice, which grew louder as the young elf who was running north through
the elevated field approached at a brisk pace.
<p>
When he arrived at the site of the graves, he put his head down and his
hands on his knees, in a momentary pause to catch but just one breath.
The elfling then walked over to one of the elves who was sitting in the
front row--indeed, the very same she-elf who had let loose a sob earlier
in the ceremony.
<p>
"You're Jasprik's sister.... are you not?" spoke the newcomer, softly, although
his presence had already disrupted the ceremony and his hushed tone was
not necessary.
<p>
"Yes, I am Celendra," she replied.  "Why have you come here at this time?"
<p>
"Something has happened....  Jasprik's house....  Th-" he stammered, not
quite ready to believe what he was about to say himself, much less convince
others of its occurrence.  Jasprik's "house," actually a small one room
building on the outskirts of town, was avoided just as much as Jasprik was
himself when he was on the prophesying prowl.  "It, it--"  The elf raised his
eyes and swallowed hard, as he tried to defend against Celendra's penetrating
stare.  "It's gone."
<p>
"Gone."  Celendra repeated the word slowly, softly, in obvious confusion.
<p>
"Yes ma'am.  But," he continued more quickly than before,
"lying among the uncovered dirt and rocks was this scroll."
He pulled out a rolled piece of paper tied with a simple string.  As he
turned the scroll, Celendra could see that a word was written on the paper.
She took the scroll, unblemished by dirt or wear, and turned it to read the
lonely word.  Written in Jasprik's handwriting, a delicate cursive rendition
of the Elven written language, was a name.
<p>
Jasprik's only surviving relation looked up at the young elf, and then at the
priest.  Her eyes were filled with astonishment and disbelief.  "Celendra,"
she began.  "It reads, 'Celendra.'"

Stoybin Arripedes caught up with Jerith at the sandy beach near Stomerd
Lake.  The hobgoblin was starting to wade out into the water, where the wooden
boat, barely afloat, was being pushed toward them slowly with each lap of
each wave.  There was a chilly wind moving across the water, and the sky
was starting to get crowded with grey afternoon clouds.  <em>"It will
rain soon,"</em> Stoybin thought to himself.  Jerith reached the craft
and at the same time pulled out his scimitar, dripping with water.
"Manawydan," he muttered to himself, gritting his pointy teeth together.
The Blackshield grabbed the side of the boat to tip it so that he could look
into it, his short stature not high enough to peer in at the sudden depth
to which he'd waded.
<p>
As Jerith tipped the boat slightly, an old elf sat up in the boat
with a look of surprise.  Jerith moved back a step, a bit startled.
The man was wearing robes the same dirt-brown color
as his vessel, and his white hair was bound up in a tight leather cap.
Long, silvery whisps of hair coiled down from underneath his hat near his
pointed ears
and danced in the wind like fairies around a magic campfire.  "Oh!  You
startled me!"  He looked at Jerith, not at all surprised or confused at
the site of such a strange rust-colored creature holding a scimitar above
the water level, then at Stoybin.  He smiled,
nodded, then looked behind him as if to confirm something.
<p>
Jerith seemed to calm a bit.  <em>"This one's harmless enough,"</em> he
decided, not seeing any symbols of his enemy, the sea god.
<p>
The man continued.  "Must've fallen asleep again!
I'm thankful you woke me; I might have
gotten a bit singed sleeping out here in the light all afternoon."  His
skin, pinker than any sun-burn Stoybin ever suffered, betrayed the fact
that he was going to be in need of an aloe salve before he retired for
the evening.  "Er, what can I do for you fellas?  It's quite a long way
from Birith."
<p>
<em>"How'd he know we came from Birith?"</em> Stoybin wondered.
<p>
"Where you heading?  How about I invite you in before it
starts to rain?  Wanna help me with the boat?"  The elf stood up suddenly,
and Stoybin thought that surely he'd capsize the boat.  Undaunted, the
man jumped overboard feet first, holding his nostrils closed with his left
hand and catching the side of the craft with his right.
<p>
Stoybin tried not to smile in mockery at the old he-elf's barrage of questions
and interesting behavior, and stepped into the lake's waters, offering his
assistance as the man started tugging his boat to the shore.  Jerith
reluctantly put his hand on the other side, feeling caught up in the situation
with no obvious reason to act hostile.  "We're actually on our
way to Kahdyr, eh, just passing through, really," Stoybin told the man,
still not quite sure what to think of him.
<p>
Jerith finally offered a sentiment, snarling.  "We <em>were</em> on our
way, but apparently my pathetic guide here decided to walk us through a lake."
<p>
"Oh really? Well, this lake's not much good for walking, unless you can
hold your breath for a while, hee hee!" The old man's response diffused
Jerith's sarcasm, much to the hobgoblin's dissapointment.
<p>
Stoybin laughed, and introduced himself and Jerith as they pulled the boat
onto the sand.  He had no qualms about explaining his relationship to the
hobgoblin, in fact, he talked about it matter-of-factly.
"I'm going to fight Jerith, to the death, once he's regained
his strength.  He's a murderer, and I mean to have him give his life
for the two he took."
<p>
Jerith smiled to himself at Stoybin's proclamation, weak as he thought it was.
<p>
"Oh, I see.  Well, let's hope Mr. Jerith here doesn't get his strength back
too soon. I just met him! Besides, I'm sure you haven't had dinner yet,
ha hee hee!"  It was Stoybin's turn show consternation at the old man's
ease at which he played upon both sides of their conflict.
<p>
"Tell you what, boys, come on over to my place and let me introduce you
to my Stu.  Then you can go on about traveling to my home town or killing
each other, or even walking under water."  The boat having been pulled
completely ashore, the old man turned and bent over, grasping both sides
of the craft as if to pick it up.  It was not much longer than he was,
and not much wider, too.
<p>
"Here, let me help--" Stoybin began, offering to pick up one end of the boat,
as surely the old man was too feeble to carry such a weight.
<p>
Suddenly the boat collapsed, and the wooden planks folded in on themselves
repeatedly, until all that remained was a miniature version of the same
craft, oars and all.  "Okay Stoybin, there ya go!"  He handed what now looked
like a trinket to the militia man from Birith, pulled up his soaked robes
somewhat and stepped past them to walk into the grasses at the southwest shore
of the Stomerd.
<p>
All Jerith could do was laugh, the first good laugh he'd had since he'd
arrived in Trassgar, and he followed the old man to a path that ran south
of the lake.  Stoybin looked at the miniature boat in his hand, smiled,
and followed.  "It's certainly never a dull day at Stomerd Lake,"
he muttered to himself, and thought of his younger days when he had
waded in these same shores.
