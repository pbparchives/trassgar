Feather Fall (Alteration)

Range: 10 yards/level
Components: V
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

	When this spell is cast, the creature(s) or
object(s) affected immediately assumes the
mass of a piece of down. Rate of falling is
instantly changed to a mere two feet per sec-
ond (120 feet per round), and no damage is
incurred upon landing while the spell is in
effect. However, when the spell duration
ceases, normal rate of fall occurs. The spell
can be cast upon the wizard or some other
creature or object up to the maximum range
and lasts for one round for each level of the
wizard. The feather fall affects one or more
objects or creatures in a 10-foot cube, as
long as the maximum weight of the crea-
tures or objects does not exceed a combined
total of 200 pounds plus 200 pounds per
level of the spellcaster.
	For example, a 2nd-level wizard has a
range of 20 yards, a duration of two rounds,
and a weight limit of 600 pounds when cast-
ing this spell. The spell works only upon
free-falling, flying, or propelled objects
(such as missiles). It does not affect a sword
blow or a charging creature. Note that the
spell can be effectively combined with gust
of wind and similar spells.
