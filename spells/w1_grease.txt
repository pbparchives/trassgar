Grease (Conjuration)
Range: 10 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 3 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 10' X 10' square area
Saving Throw: Special

	A grease spell covers a material surface
with a slippery layer of a fatty, greasy
nature. Any creature entering the area or
caught in it when the spell is cast must save
vs. spell or slip, skid, and fall. Those who
successfully save can reach the nearest non-
greased surface by the end of the round.
Those who remain in the area are allowed a
saving throw each round until they escape
the area. The DM should adjust saving
throws by circumstance; for example, a
creature charging down an incline that is
suddenly greased has little chance to avoid
the effect, but its ability to exit the affected
area is almost assured! The spell can also be
used to create a greasy coating on an itemÄ
a rope, ladder rungs, weapon handle, etc.
Material objects not in use are always
affected by this spell, while creatures wield-
ing or employing items receive a saving
throw vs. spell to avoid the effect. If the ini-
tial saving throw is failed, the creature
immediately drops the item. A saving throw
must be made each round the creature
attempts to use the greased item. The caster
can end the effect with a single utterance;
otherwise it lasts for three rounds plus one
round per level.
	The material component of the spell is a
bit of pork rind or butter.
