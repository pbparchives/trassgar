Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

	By means of this spell, the wizard creates
a magical field of force that serves as if it
were ring mail armor (AC 6). The spell has
no effect on a person already armored or a
creature with Armor Class 6 or better. It is
not cumulative with the shield spell, but it is
cumulative with Dexterity and, in the case
of fighter/mages, with the shield bonus.
The armor spell does not hinder movement,
adds no weight or encumbrance, nor does it
prevent spellcasting. It lasts until successful-
ly dispelled or until the wearer sustains
cumulative damage totaling greater than 8
points + 1 per level of the caster. (It is
important to note that the armor does not
absorb this damage. The armor merely
grants an AC of 6; the wearer still suffers
full damage from any successful attacks.)
Thus, the wearer might suffer 8 points from
an attack, then several minutes later sustain
an additional 1 point of damage. Unless the
spell were cast by a wizard of 2nd level or
higher, it would be dispelled at this time.
Until it is dispelled, the armor spell grants
the wearer full benefits of the Armor Class
gained.
	The material component is a piece of fine-
ly cured leather that has been blessed by a
cleric.
