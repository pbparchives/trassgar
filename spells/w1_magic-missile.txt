Use of the magic missile spell creates up to
five missiles of magical energy that dart
forth from the wizard's fingertip and unerr-
ingly strike their target. This includes ene-
my creatures in a melee. The target creature
must be seen or otherwise detected to be hit,
however, so near-total concealment, such as
that offered by arrow slits, can render the
spell ineffective. Likewise, the caster must
be able to identify the target. He cannot
direct a magic missile to "Strike the com-
mander of the legion," unless he can single
out the commander from the rest of the sol-
diers. Specific parts of a creature cannot be
singled out. Inanimate objects (locks, etc.)
cannot be damaged by the spell, and any
attempt to do so wastes the missiles to no
effect. Against creatures, each missile
inflicts 1d4 + 1 points of damage.
	For every two extra levels of experience,
the wizard gains an additional missile--he
has two at 3rd level, three at 5th level, four
at 7th level, etc., up to a total of five missiles
at 9th level. If the wizard has multiple mis-
sile capability, he can have them strike a sin-
gle target creature or several creatures, as
desired.
