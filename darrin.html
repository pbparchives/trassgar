<strong>Darrin's Saga</strong>

<h3 align="center">
<A NAME="1">1</A><br />
September 13, 2000
</h3>

<p>
<span class="dm">[DM's note: The same night the 'Ghoul Quest'
adventurers have stopped for a rest, Darrin Throshna's adventures begin.
We'll call it, 'Elf Quest'. Sorry, I couldn't resist!]</span></p>
<p>
<span class="dm">
Darrin Throshna inwardly cursed his luck as he looked at his cards.</span>
Games of chance were his favorites, and card games fit that bill nicely. But
this deck of cards seemed to favor his adversaries. He held on to his inner
confidence by silently repeating his favorite mantra: "I will always walk away
with something." Darrin smiled and looked up at the three elves seated around
the table from him. The elf to his left had bet two coppers.
<p>
Directly across from Darrin sat an unusually fat elf. Darrin couldn't remember
ever seeing a fat elf before. But, he couldn't remember ever seeing himself
with such an awful hand--make that string of hands--of cards, either.  The
elf studied Darrin, tried to read his face, tried to get some kind of glimpse
into Darrin's cards by the look on his face.
<p>
<span class="dm">[Charisma check: Needs &lt;= 9, rolls 6. Darrin is slick,
stoic and unreadable as ever!]</span>
<p>
He sighed, not able to read Darrin's thoughts, and resigned himself to his
action. He pushed two coppers into the middle of the table, matching the
bet. "Alright, I match." The fat elf smiled and looked to his left.
<p>
The elf to the right of Darrin looked nervously at his own cards and 
his dwindling stash of coppers. He quietly stacked his
cards up and placed them face down on the table. "I gotta eat tonight!"
he explained, placing his hands protectively over his few remaining 
coins.
<p>
Low stakes gambling wasn't quite the life Darrin envisioned for
himself when he'd said 'good bye' to his mentor and set out on his own for a
life of adventure. But he had to start somewhere, and the Shiny Crown seemed
a harmless and low-life place enough to practice some of his trade. It was
far enough away from his home settlement to where the locals didn't know
who he was. But it was close enough to Furterville--in the northern
mountainous outskirts, to be specific, that he was guaranteed plenty of
variety and an endless supply of new faces. One thing he was not 
guaranteed,
though, was that he would win this hand of cards. He'd already lost 15 coppers
(1/2 a silver and 5 coppers) tonight!
<p>
<span class="dm">[DM: The fat elf looks a bit nervous,
and the elf to your left is hard to
read. By the way, your hand of cards STINKS. What do you do?
Think of this as some kind of poker game. Whether you will eventually win or
lose, you now have a chance to get some character development on the table,
and see if you can use your rogueish nature to get yourself out of this one.
The pot has 40 coppers in it, and you think they'd feel real nice clanging
around in your belt pouch. The bet right now is two coppers. What do you do?
Treat this game just like regular poker for all practical purposes. You
can either fold, match the bet, or raise the bet, or think of something
non-traditional to do....]</span>

The fat elf was easy to read... he had a hand no better than 
Darrin's. But, that didn't reassure him about his own hand because he had the 
lowest possible hand! Biting his lip, he gestured in such a way that 
would lead the fat elf to believe he was folding. At the last moment before
the cards were placed on the rough wooden table, Darrin raised them 
back up, eyed the elf to his left, his cards,
the elf again, and spoke. "I'll see 
your two coppers... and raise you one more." Sliding three coppers across the 
table top, Darrin eyed the elf nervously knowing that there was no 
way he could beat him. After releasing his hand from the coppers Darrin 
sat back into his chair and eyed his cards and remembered a time when 
such deception saved his life. 
<p>
Darrin entered into a solem trance, no longer paying attention to the 
game in which he was about to lose. His mind was clouded with the wispy 
images of chaos, smoke and blood. The screaming of his mother and 
brother. The pain, confusion, blackness.... 
<p>
Darrin popped back into the game as quick as he had left when the fat 
elf spoke something. "Wha, What was that you said?" asked Darrin.

<p>
As Darrin awaited the next move by the elf to his left, he was suddenly 
overcome with drowsiness.  Was something in his brew, something he ate? 
Or was it the fact that his opponent was taking a long time to call his 
move?  In anywhich way, Darrin eyed the slim elf and then glanced at the 
chubby one, hoping that he would never become as big as he.</p>

<h3 align=center>
<A NAME="3">3</A><br>

</h3>

<p>
<span class="dm">"I said," quipped the fat elf, "that I'm
impressed."</span></p>

<p>Darrin turned to the other elf who was considering staying in the game by
   matching Darrin's bet. Darrin figured he was a bit nervous about meeting
   the new bet, considering his original bet wasn't that high from the beginning.</p>

<p>
   Darrin's assessment of the situation was correct, as the elf to his left
   folded his cards. The fat elf looked surprised at this.</p>

<p>
   "Hey!" the first elf spoke. "I was only bluffing to begin with!" he explained.</p>

<p>
   "Well, I'm certainly not bluffing!" The rotund he-elf turned his attention
   to Darrin. "I see your raise. Let's see what you got!" The fat elf threw in
   one more copper to the pile of coins at the center of the small wooden table.
   This, he followed up with putting his own cards down on the table.</p>

<p>
   "You got me!" Darrin put his own cards down face up. He was clearly beaten,
   but he kept a jovial face. The fat elf laughed and scooped up his winnings.
   Darrin stayed seated and watched him collect his money and also the cards;
   the other two elves had stood up and bid their good-byes. They walked over to
   the bar with arms around each other's shoulder in mock consolation for each
   other, laughing the whole way.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>
   The winner eyed Darrin curiously for a moment.
   "You got spunk," the elf spoke in the common tongue. "You stayed in, knowing
   you were beaten, hoping to scare us off with your bluff."
   He pocketed his winnings in a belt pouch at his side. "Maybe you
   think you can steal this back before the night is through?" He folded his
   hands in front of him, and addressed Darrin in elvish in favor of the common
   tongue they had spoke in during the game.</p>

<p>
   "You understand me, no?" He paused, waiting for an answer.</p>

<p>
   Darrin nodded. He was as comfortable speaking elvish as he was speaking in
   'common.'</p>

<p>
   "Ok then, I have a challenge. You don't seem to be the usual type, drifting
   through here. I also don't think you normally stay in a betting game when
   your hand is so bad. You are out to test yourself, are you not?" Not pausing
   long enough for Darrin to formulate an answer, he continued. "I'm betting
   you are, and I'm betting you want something more grand than some low-life
   gambling hall on the edge of one of the greatest towns in all of north
   Trassgar." He squinted his eyes. "What do you say. Do you want in this
   new game? It's not cards, but the potential winnings are a lot more than a few
   coppers."</p>

<p>
   Darrin had lost, but he might just have a chance to walk away with something
   after all. Just as he knew he would.</p>

<h3 align="center">
<a name="4">4</a><br />
October 14, 2000</h3>

<p>
Darrin smirked with a half grin-half smile.  "Losing coppers isn't my idea of fun" spoke Darrin in the elvish tongue, "However, this you speak
   of does seem rather interesting and has sparked my curiosity."</p>

<p>
   Gesturing the fat elf to walk to the bar Darrin pulled out several more coppers from his pouch, and offered the fat elf a mug of the native
   brew, himself taking a mug too. "I don't mind buying for a stranger who has just beat me at my own game... and fear not, I'm won't get you
   drunk to redeem my coppers! You got them fair and square. Please, tell me your name?" spoke darrin, holding his hand out in a friendly
   hand shake. "I'm Darrin Throshna from... well... a bunch of different places. I was just passing through and thought I might replenish my
   dwindling stash of coppers here... seems that didn't work out as I had hoped!"</p>

<p>
Glancing at his half full mug... or half empty mug... (however you look at it)... he looked at the fat elf (whose name he knows by now) and
   asked in elvish and in a low tone, "So tell me, what is this 'new game' that you speak of? I never pass up opportunities that may be in my
   favor, especially those 'games' that pay in the end. You were correct in saying that I'm testing myself... and looking for something more
   grand in life. Excuse me..." Darrin couldn't quite get comfortable as this hand cross bow was poking his side, so he breifly pulled it out to
   sling it around his belt so that it hung there resting on his leg. Now he could listen without any disturbances. "That's better, now, I'm
   listening."</p>

<h3 align="center">
<a name="5">5</a><br />
November 9, 2000</h3>

<p>
<span class="dm">The rather rotund he-elf returned Darrin's handshake and
offered his name.</span>
"Call me Bormyn. I'm from, well, a bunch of different places, too, but most
recently I find myself hanging around Furterville." He took several swigs
from his ale. "Ah, nothing tastes better than a tankard of free brew." Wiping
his lips with his sleeve, Bormyn nodded to his recently defeated card-playing
opponent in thanks. He placed his mug down in front of him and stared
forward at nothing in particular as he continued.</p>

<p>
"There's a travelling band of magicians that made their way through these
parts last week. Did a pretty good show here. Maybe you've heard of them--the
Kohks Brothers?"</p>

<p>
Darrin nodded. He'd even seen them perform once. They were practicers of
sleight of hand, but he wasn't convinced that they didn't use a little magic
in their act. As he listened, Darrin scanned the tavern. The patrons all
seemed harmless and no one seemed to be paying any special attention to anyone
else. A few people sat by themselves with only their mugs to keep them
company.</p>

<p>
"Well, they left one of their bags of props behind, maybe got misplaced under
the stage or something. Anyways, they can't spare the time to come back for it
as they're on a schedule that takes 'em out east. They sent word to the
owner here that they'd pay handsomely for somebody to rush it up to them."
Borymn turned to Darrin. "You don't seem like the courier-type." Bormyn
seemed to size Darrin up, grinned, and spoke mischievously, "That's ok.
A courier's already been sent up north. He started out this morning."</p>

<p>
"So what's the challenge?" Darrin asked, not sure where Bormyn's tale was
going to end.</p>

<p>
"Challenge is, I think we should show the Kohks Brothers some sleight of
hand, Furterville-style." Bormyn grinned.</p>

<p>
"You mean, steal their props."</p>

<p>
"Yesiree, you catch on quick. Interested?"</p>

<h3 align="center">
<a name="6">6</a><br />
November 17, 2000</h3>

<p>
"Sounds fun." Darrin responded with a wide grin smeared on his half-elvish face.
"So how long head start does this courier have again? Left this morning, huh?"
asked Darrin. Knowing he started out this morning, Darrin had some catching up
to do.</p>

<p>
"So what's the expected return for this 'sleight of hand' Furterville-style?"
asked Darrin. "This courier, is there anything special I should
know about him?" Darrin took his last swig of brew and wiped his lips.
"Another? Also, I will need a detailed description of the courier if
I'm to find him, and which paths he would have likely taken. Bormyn, did you
see this bag of props for yourself? Size, fabric, color... you
know.... I like to switch things around once in a while... hee hee hee! I
wouldn't want to be in the courier's shoes when he presents a bag of
rubbing sticks and horse shoes!" Darrin, amused by his comment,
looked around the tavern and remarked, "I'm in, and the sooner I leave...
the better..."</p>

<h3 align="center">
<a name="7">7</a><br />
January 14, 2001</h3>

<p>
<span class="dm">
   Bormyn explained to Darrin the compensation he'd receive
   for stealing the prop bag.</span>
   "There's a few guilds in the area recruiting
   right now. Membership in a thieves' guild has its privileges. Let's say I
   put in a good word for you in my circle of associates. Of course, we also
   can put the prop bag up on the black market. It'd fetch a fair price I'd
   bet. But the most important part of all this would be the respect. A thief
   like you trying to make it big--you need respect. Snatching this bag'll get
   you on that road." Bormyn smiled a serious smile. "At least among the
   circle of thieves."
   </p><p>
   Darrin rode swift and hard as the fading daylight was overcome by the
   dark of dusk. His horse, which had carried him throughout his wanderings of
   late, huffed and puffed in the early evening's cool air, but was well-rested
  and ready for the run. Bormyn figured the courier had a good five or six hours
   head start, but offered his assurances that Darrin would catch up if he
   rode into the dark. The courier was only human, after all, and wasn't
   going to ride at night. Darrin, with his elven night vision, a good
   knowledge of the roads in the area, and a deep interest in the chase,
   was sure to catch up. As for the courier, he was a twenty-something, brown
  hair, kind of lanky, riding a brown horse branded on its left rear haunch with
   the mark of the local stables, "NF" for North Furter.
   </p><p>
   Bormyn pointed out that the most
   distinguishing characteristic of his quarry would be the prop bag. Darrin
   mulled over the last of their conversation as he rode. "It's big and bulky.
   You see somebody speeding along their merry way with a huge bag strapped to
   their horse, that's your bag. You get close enough, you'll see it's a dark
  blue bag of some kind of thick material. Yellow-colored rope for a drawstring.
   I got a good look at it as it was being strapped up for the ride. You should
   recognize it easily, I think." As for the route taken, "Kokhs' is paying big
   money for the speedy delivery. Fastest way would be along the easiest pass
   over the mountains, and then east into the woodlands."
   </p><p>
   Yes, he'd have no trouble catching up. If he were the courier, he'd probably
   stop at that inn buried in the middle of the peaks--what was its name?
   If he were to miss him, he'd keep on the fastest roads northeast and east
   on to the town of Sage, where the Kokhs apparently were setting up shop for
   their next performance.
   </p><p>
   Soon night was upon him. The light of the waxing moons outlined the dirt
   path and surrounding rocky terrain with a silvery net of shadows and subdued
   greys. When he felt it wasn't safe any more to ride at the brisk pace he had
   his horse maintaining, he slowed down to a trot.
   </p><p>
   That's when he heard it--the awful, terrible scream coming from straight
   ahead, just out of sight.
   </p><p>
   <span class="dm">[[DM: Darrin, what do you do?]]</span>

<h3 align="center">
<a name="8">8</a><br />
January 22, 2001</h3>

   <p>
Darrin froze, halting the advance of his steed. "What the heck was that?"
Darrin thought to himself. He stared into the dark trying to visualize
what made that terrifying shreak. But even with his elvish night
vision he was unable to make out what lays ahead of him. He quickly
dismounted his horse and pulled it behind the biggest rock that
was nearby on the trail he was on. He lashed the reigns around a small
available bolder while wispering, "You'll be ok buddy, just be quiet for
me would ya?" He turned his attention to where the scream came
from and approached the direction with caution using great cat-like prowlness.
Using the surrounding rocks and boulders as cover, Darrin
did his best to stay off the trail he was just on. He couldn't help but think
what he was about to get into and if it was really worth the repect
he yearned for. This was supposed to be an easy theft...
</p><p>
He imagined Ogres ripping the arms off his body and worst yet eating them.
That sent a chill down his spine, but as far as he knew, he had
the advantage of not yet being detected. This reassurance calmed down his
nerves a little, allowing him to focus on the present situation. He
stopped and slowly panned the dark landscape looking for anything out of the
ordinary that stuck out (other than that scream) taking note
of possible escape routes and hiding cubby-holes. He searched for flickering
light from a camp fire, movement from a foot or arm, odd
shadows that rocks and boulders don't cast in the moonlight, anything.... 

<h3 align="center">
<a name="9">9</a><br />
February 8, 2001</h3>
<p>
<span class="dm">
Darrin scanned in silence, easily staying hidden in the plethora of shadows
snuggled among the rocks and boulders.
[[Hide in Shadows skill (45%) plus a significant (+30%) bonus due to
night-time: needs 75 or less, rolls 72--made it.]]
</span>

With his eyes, he followed 
the trail as it snaked around north and west, through groves of tall trees,
and oddly placed boulders.  Standing slightly crouched with hands against the
rock face, Darrin listened and searched the area for the source of the scream.
</p><p>	
"There," he noted to himself.  A flickering of light across the trail to the
northeast he glimpsed through the tree trunks, branches, and foilage, and
despite the darkness. It was a campfire, he thought.  He heard muffled
exclamations and grunts coming from that direction.  Darrin's infravision was
spoiled by the light of the campfire; he'd have to get closer to find out
anything further.
</p>

<h3 align="center">
<a name="10">10</a><br />
February 21, 2001</h3>
<p>
Leaving the rock upon which Darrin leaned, he grabbed his hand cross 
bow, pulling the string back with some effort, and knocking a bolt to it. 
Skillfully making his way closer to the light and grunts, he make sure 
nothing was in his way to prevent him from getting to the hilt of his 
sword. He couldn't help being filled with fear but he remembered what his 
master told him once...</p>
<blockquote>
"Fear is a good thing because it means you're 
alive... and will help you stay that way too. Only fools are fearless... 
and that's about when they die. Let it guide you, but not control you, 
and you will do well in your quest of life."</blockquote>
<p>
Darrin gulped struggling 
from letting it get the best of him... control he though, control... as he 
approached the site he readied himself for anything, at least that's 
what he thought...
</p>

<h3 align="center">
<a name="11">11</a><br />
March 13, 2001</h3>
<p>
<span class="dm">Darrin crept closer to the source of the muffled noises and 
flickering light, gripping his hand crossbow firmly.</span> He crossed the 
path and entered the thicket of trees, tall grass and bushes on the other 
side. His eyes were constantly in motion, scanning the ground for the 
best places to put his silent steps, picking the best course through the 
branches, all the while keeping a fix on his destination. Finally he 
was close enough to make out the scene, so he stopped and held a position 
behind the trunk of one of the thicker trees about ten paces south of 
the fire.
</p><p>
What he saw puzzled him. There was a small campfire--not a very good 
one, he thought, not that he could have done much better. Of course he'd 
concentrated more on developing his thieving and spellcasting skills. 
Making campfires were for rough, tough, sleep-in-the-woods types of 
adventurers, not the likes of him! At least, so he used to believe about 
himself before he'd started out on his own. Opposite the campsite from 
him stood two horses, their reins tied around the branches of another 
tree. One of the horses was pitch-black. The other was a chocolate brown 
color. They faced each other as if they might have been discussing how 
good their bits tasted. Overall, the two seemed content enough to stand 
silently, shaking their manes every so often, more often than not 
ignoring the gagged and bound, hands and feet, man lying nearby. The source 
of the muffled grunts, Darrin discovered.
</p><p>
In the flickering of the fire's light, Darrin's attention turned back 
to the brown horse's rear at the urging of a hunch. He knew what he was 
looking for, and he found it. He didn't expect to find it here, at a 
campsite, tethered and definitely not delivering any type of courier and 
trick bag post-haste to the Kokhs Brothers. Indeed, just as Bormyn 
described, the brown horse sported a circlular-shaped branding mark, with 
the letters "NF" in the middle.
</p><p>
Returning his attention to the bound man, he quickly reasoned that he 
was the courier. He was human, skinny enough and young-looking enough to 
fit the description given him. Bormyn hadn't mentioned anything about a 
penchant for lying down on the job, or tying himself up, for that 
matter, but Darrin guessed that was his man.
</p><p>
The half-elf shifted a bit quietly, and considered the scene. He'd 
found the courier, the horse, but where was the bag--"Ah ha!" he almost 
said aloud to himself. There, off to the left. The bag, yellow drawstring 
at all. It was bulky, dark blue--he guessed anyway in the dim light of 
the puny fire. It was also open, at least, he guessed from his vantage 
point. Darrin was surprised. He rather expected Bormyn to be lying 
about something; after all, the fat elf was a thief and that was, well, 
sort of part of the package, wasn't it?
</p><p>
The courier, bound, gagged, and from the looks of him quite 
uncomfortable lying there struggling to get free of his bonds. The bag, plopped 
unceremoniously on the ground. Two horses. And no sign of anyone who 
could have made that painful-sounding scream he'd heard on the path 
earlier. Not at all what he expected. Just the way he liked it.

Darrin looked behind and around him scanning the woods for another.
Bormyn described the brown horse and rider but did not mention anything about
a black horse... this made him uneasy... not to mention that his "goods" in
the prop bag may have been swiped by the looks of the open bag. Darrin turned
his attention to the struggling man on the ground. Darrin wasn't a mean elf
but he is or was going to steal from him. He decided he would leave him on
the ground tied up before he made his move.</p>

<p>Quietly he stepped from his cover
looking around him and at the courier. He took a path that would lead him by
the prop bag so he could get a good look at it and possibly into it, acting as
if he were looking for someone. As soon as the courier locked eyes on Darrin,
he motioned with this index finger to remain silent and calm, meanwhile panning
the wood line readying himself for anything. He made his way to the courier
gesturing for him to remain quiet.</p>

<p>He spoke softly "Be quiet, they don't know I'm here. I've been tracking
them." But of course Darrin had no idea what or who they were, nor how
many.</p>

<p>Darrin ungagged the courier while telling him to speak soflty. "Are you ok?
Which direction did they go and did they take anything from you?" Darrin hoped
his ploy worked because he needed that prop bag, or what ever was in it.</p>

<span class="dm">
The courier, relieved to see a friendly face, spilled all as quickly and as
quietly as possible.</span></p>

<p>
"They waylaid me, and were celebrating about something or another.  They
mentioned something about how they got here first, between slobbering over
perfectly good meats as if they were dogs."  A look of disgust passed over his
face as the memory moved through his mind.  He shook his head softly.  "So
then they started drinking, and one thought he heard something.  'I'm going to
check it out' he says to the others, and then the others say, 'Oh no you're
not you thieving piece of dung, not alone you're not' and then they start all
that such banter.  As it turned out, sounds kept coming from that glen over
there to the north," he said, craning his neck as if to point in the
appropriate direction.</p>

<p>"As soon as they were gone, the one that they had left behind, the
'trustworthy' one, had him a look-see into the bag-and poof!  He was gone!
Then this little halfling comes sneakin' outta the forest and picks up the bag,
only to hear the others returning.  So he looks in real quick-like, and poof!
He was gone!  Made me believe they had put some kind of drug in me ale, it
did!"</p>

<p>"What do you mean, they were gone?" Darrin asked, doubtful.</p>

<p>"I mean they was no more-totally gone.  The others were hiding in the
bushes when the little halfling tried to look in, and saw him disappear,
and started swearing about magics and wizardry and they'd been had, and took
off, leaving their booty behind them.  That was only a few minutes before you
showed up."</p>

<p>"Thank you, friend!" Darrin replied.  "Can I get you anything to eat or
drink, or perhaps put a burlap over you before I go?"</p>

<p>
"You're not going to just up and leave me here, are ye?" the courier whimpered,
watching as Darrin walked over and picked up the bag.</p>

<p>
But he didn't have time to answer.  Almost a split second after he sensed them,
a band of rather menacing looking elves crept quietly out of the wood,
all weapons trained on him.  Somehow he knew that they weren't the ordinary
elves, and he could feel their bloodthirsty plans for him.  In the seconds
that they moved closer and he realized that there was no escaping their circle,
he heard the courier's pleadings and then a ripping sound.  Silence.  The
courier would plead no more.</p>
 
<p>
For a moment Darrin felt guilt for leaving the poor man tied, but it was brief.
He had to decide what to do.</p>
