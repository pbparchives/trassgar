Yeah, just send Ben your new move along with any corresponding rolls you've made and he'll edit it with all the requisite DM stuff (yellow text).
If you don't know what rolls have to be made for
a particular scene, email Ben about the scenario, and he'll give you some advice.  Good luck!<br>

These moves made up for the wait! <bR>

<B>Status Update:</B> the aforementioned Great Salad Toss(TM) is undergoing heavy re-formatting to bring the online battle script into HTML (with a few editorial flourishes).  After I'm done with it (let's say by Monday), it goes to ye grand ol' DM and hi

Since I last heard. Jerith has started to play the banjo. He has taken a vacation to the southern islands and has masterd multi variable calculus. Recently he began a franchise of selling embossed sea shells as diplomas from his school of philosophy. Yep,
he sure has had a lot of free time lately :) :) :) :)<br>

Greetings true, patient believers!
<p>
Yesternight,
I stole an hour of my evening to pen the next
installment for Tobin Ashara ("T'Asha"), although
part of the move needs some details still.  The
important thing is that, no, I'm not dead, the
game is going on, but due to sickness, school starting and of course, work and family, I've not
squeaked out any other moves.  With Tobin's move
basically finished, Jerith's next plot is ready
to go in my head; but, of course I can't abandon Olen and friends.  I'm trying to juggle many things right now, and I hope to succeed in that effort and get this game back moving right along!  <p>
And to answer the question of the unknown poster (below), check out Tilder's page and read all about him!

Leafy green plant monsters may pack a whollop,

BUT I'VE FORGOTTEN WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE, much
less what happened that fateful night Tilder and

I thought that Jerith's 2nd installment was interesting and revolting at the same time.  It is going to be a challenge for me to play Amber on this one.  Tobin, however, will be an easier persona to master in respect to Jerith.  Quite simply, she'll want 
o kill him.  Amber, however, may be more ambiguous on the matter... I'm still trying to decide how she might respond to a monster-person who kills for hire.  Will she be able to look past it given the bestial nature of the murderer?  It's giving me some f
od for thought re:her character development.<br>

The aforementioned leafy green monster conflict
hasn't been written up in narrative text yet.
Stacy and also Dave are tackling that chapter.
<p>
As for other new moves by moi, I'm working
on chapter two for Tobin, and next up will be
Olen and friends.
<p>
As for Jerith part 2, hey, that guy is one
bad honcho.  Make that one bad BLEEDING honcho.
I think I actually like having a "bad guy" for
one of the main characters of this story.  We'll
see how it pans out!<br>

<strong>Online battle a success!</strong><br>
Sunday night, the minds behind Tilder, Amber
and Gnash Gnarly met on line (via
<a href="http://www.aol.com/aim/">AIM</a>) and
played out the next move for the Vortex
questers.  Actually, it turned out to be quite
a battle.  Just who were those green leafy
monsters that tried to make our trio of heroes
their next meal?  No one knows...  Stay tuned in
the days to come for the novelized version of
that battle chat.
<p>
<strong>New moves, where art thou?</strong><br>
Stacy and I will be accompanying Simon on his
Baby Tour '98 II, as we travel to the good ol'
southland.  No, I'm not talking about
Cactus Ridge, but rather, Alabama and Louisiana.
I won't be cranking out any moves during this
time, the 3rd through the 12th, but I'll try to
get Olen and co.'s next move out before then,
as well as an extension of Jerith's first
chapter.
<p>
That's it for now, true believers.  Until the
moons of Trassgar are found to be made of
cheddar, I remain, yours truly, the Almighty DM.<br>

Send your moves to Ben, preferably already formatted, then he will post them.  (I figure at this rate I'd better reply since he has no time to speak of!)<br>

Re: Jerith<br>
Since I'm privy to Jerith's moves before they are posted (I check Ben's e-mail for him sometimes), I can predict, with some certainty, that Jerith is going to have less-than-friendly interactions with Tobin and the Amber/Gnash contingent at the rate he's 
oing.  THis should provide for some fascinating character interaction!<br>

<strong>Vortex Quest</strong><br>
Well, last night I attempted to crank out the
latest Vortex saga, but my creative juices must
have been flowing a bit too slowly, as after
2.5 hours I couldn't wrap it up.  But look for
that move to come soon, and another move to show
up this weekend.  I gots some ideas, fellas!
<p>
<strong>Dracor</strong><br>
I got someone to convert Mr. Immortal from
Rifts to ADND and he might as well be a
"lesser being."  Some major work and DM
machinations are in progress to get this guy
ADND-ified enough in plot and abilities to allow
him to fit right in.
<p>
<strong>St'eelcoil</strong><br>
Got a sketch.  I'll try scanning it tonight
before I leave.  Mwa ha ha.
<p>
<strong>Moves (in general)</strong><br>
Major apologies for the delays in the DM getting
moves cranked out.  I keep saying to myself that
I'll have plenty of time on weekends, but then
we go and do stuff.  Please don't smite me!
Wait a minute, <em>I'm</em> the DM.  You mere
mortals can't smite me!  Whuagh ha ha!<br>

Ice monsters are no excuse.  You're fired.

<B>Re: Pitch-black Trassgarian nights</B><BR>
Well, I'm assuming Trassgar would be far enough
away from a hypothetical double star as not to cook the elves and other assorted beasties....
If so, planetary rotation would still guarantee nice dark nights.  But like you stated, the 
moons could pose a problem, especially if 
they're big relative to Trassgar's size.  Keep
in mind though, that Earth's moon is anomalously big at nearly 1/6 our beloved planet's mass; 
most satellites are miniscule compared to the planets they orbit, and so they reflect less 
light (especially if they're captured asteroids,
which tend to have low albedo, or reflectance).  So chances are still good for the famed dark nights on Trassgar!  We'll just have to wait and
see how Finty (or the DM) rolls those planetary
dice....

Re: The Weather

Unfortunatly, a giant ice monster toppled by doppler radar tower outside of ice city (talk about some propagation!), and my satellite uplink is also down.  So as far as hurricane seasons and such, i can offer no help.

Re: Hobgoblins

Perhaps Olen's new move will get all you true-believers thinking.

Re: Re:

I like responses to messages like this.  it's fun.

Re: Solar System Stuff

So, have we decided on a number of moons and/or suns?  Scientifically thinking with a little 2010: The Year We Make Contact in mind, TWO suns may prevent those classic pitch-black Trassgarian nights, wouldn't it?  And wouldn't a multiple set of planetary 
atellites have a similar effect?<br>

On the topic of hobgoblins, check out Jerith's
introductory story.  The reason Tilder hasn't
seen a hobgoblin before will become clear in
due time.
<p>
As for
Draco<strong>r</strong>, he's the Rifts RPG
character Bryan is going to play--or is he?  I
went ahead and stubbed in his character for
completenes.  Still waiting on that char sheet,
Bryan, so we can convert him!
<p>
On the subject of indigenous humanoidal
races to Trassgar,
we have the elves, and that's it.  The other
races were shipped in.  It is not clear at
this time which of these races, if any, know
of their origins on the planet.  However, the
prophets calling for a native halfling isn't
fallible, for Tilder surely was born on
Trassgar, even if his ancestors weren't.  More
on that in moves and history to come.
<p>
Stay tuned true believers!<br>

Shaping up nicely, guys!  Hey.... is this Dracon dude one of
the "lesser beings"?  Now <EM>that</EM> would make things interesting....  Classifying the Ikra as a religion which consists of devotion to a supreme being now makes
more sense in the light (eek!) of my last comment.
<P>
I've got a few questions to help me get this straight: Tilder 
has no idea he's from another world.  Then what about the 
ancient prophecy about a "native Trassgarian halfling"?  Could the prophets and Scrub/Shack not know about the gates either?  I thought S/S was using a "cousin" of the gates to teleport beings within Trassgar?  Do the gates have a "forget" feature by whic
 gated beings forget about being gated?  Otherwise, the gates' existence might be more widely known, if indeed known at all.  OK, that was my three coppers' worth.<br>
